### Name of taxi: Ivan Yhen

My friends and I flagged down a cab from Paragon Plaza going to Megamall (which is only 2 MRT stops away). We didn't see until the taxi was in motion that the meter wasn't running. When we called the driver's attention to it, he said, "Bigyan niyo na lang ako ng P100 ma'am." Also, he took a longer route, presumably to justify the high fare he was asking for, and pretended he didn't know the way. It was just one straight line along EDSA!

```Over charging, No meter```
