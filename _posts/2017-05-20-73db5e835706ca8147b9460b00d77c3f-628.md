title: UVG216 - Robinson's Ermita to Quirino Avenue Paco
---

### Name of taxi: forgot

Usual fare from Robinson's Ermita to our place Quirino Avenue before Osmena Hwy is more than P60 but less than P70. Meter ended at P93. I told him I always take the cab via this route & very sure it does not reach more than P70, with moderate traffic na yan. Driver said "e yun ang nakalagay sa metro ko e". I told him, he needs to give me my change of P30 or I'll take his plate number. And he shouted "e di kunin mo!". I said since an MMDA can be sighted at that time, I told him he can report me if I insists on my change. Then he gave me P30. Tapos umalis na sya.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
