### Name of taxi: GrabCar

I booked a ride for my sister around 7pm. I did the booking because my sister is on hurry preparing for her work. A certain Julius Dulay Gacosta accepted the book therefore my sister waited and even called & texted him the way to our unit ... although we knew he had a tracker. At around 7:53 he texted me using a different number requesting me to just cancel the booking, and after few seconds he canceled the booking himself. That is so unprofessional! My sister waisted more than 30 minutes and she ended up very late in her work.

```Refused boarding```
