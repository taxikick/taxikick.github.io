### Name of taxi: M.G.E

The driver made us with no choice but to agree with him contracting instead of using the taxi meter on our travel from buendia to mall of asia. Then, charged us almost double the price of usual fare saying because of heavy traffic when it turned out it was not really heavy at all

```Over charging, No meter```
