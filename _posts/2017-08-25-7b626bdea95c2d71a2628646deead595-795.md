### Name of taxi: ALJOHN'S TAXI

August 24, 2017 around 5 p.m at Jollibee Arayat, Barangay San Martin De Porres, Cubao, Quezon City, I and my 3 office mates took a taxi going to CCF Center, Frontera Verde, Ortigas Avenue. The taxi driver doesn't want to use taxi meter as he asked us 200.00 because we are 4. We then did not take his taxi and find another one who is polite in manner. But I only have the chance to memorize his taxi number and body name. This is surprising as we usually paid the taxi driver using taxi meter at cost of 100.00-113.00 if week days and 100-106 if Saturday & Sunday. This driver needs disciplinary action as many passengers he maybe taken advantage especially those who don't know how to complain. Thanks for the action taken on this matter.
