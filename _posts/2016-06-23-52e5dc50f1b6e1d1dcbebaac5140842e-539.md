### Name of taxi: sorry, i cant recall

charge on the meter was Php89 and since there is Php10 deduction for taxi meters, we expected that the change was Php20. however, he gave us Php10 only.. i told him that there is a Php10 deduction for taxi fare... he was muttering something and what we only heard was "blah blah blah queensland"! i told him that we did not get inside the taxi in queensland because we were from landbank mandaue branch.. he still insisted that it was the case... scared that he might do something physically, i took the Php10 change and alighted from the taxi... i got so annoyed that the only info i got was the plate number!

```Over charging```
