title: GXN962 - From Mactan bridge to Sm City Cebu
---

### Name of taxi: Forgot

From Mactan Bridge going to sm city cebu. The meter was on while on the way to sm city cebu but upon arrival he suddenly turned off the meter and demanded me to pay 150 pesos, however the usual fare from the bridge to sm city cebu will not reach 100 peso especially it was already late at night. Is that how taxi drivers treat foreign tourist? Always asking for more money? Thats really bad. Taxi drivers should really change. Seriously. Im not kidding around. 

```Over charging, No meter```
