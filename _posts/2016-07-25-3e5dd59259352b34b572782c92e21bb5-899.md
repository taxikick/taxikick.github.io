### Name of taxi: forgot

took a Cab at Makati, while nearing on the Destination i said that my money is whole 200 pesos total bill was 145 pesos, he just gave me 20 pesos instead and when i ask him why? he said. "wala tayong magagawa" then he starts cursing me, i was really pissed by that time and the experience, i am not up to the change but his rude behavior can really ruin your day, i hope this report will help us to give a right mind set to those annoying taxi drivers. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
