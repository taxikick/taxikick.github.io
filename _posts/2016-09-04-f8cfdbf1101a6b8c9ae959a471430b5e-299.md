### Name of taxi: not sure

When i went inside the taxi, he drove off and suddenly mentioned that his meter was not working. 
He pressed a couple of buttons until i guess it worked. Then while driving, the driver was also texting. The AC was not turned out. It smelled awful inside his cab. When I was near my location, he refused to go further because according to him the machine cannot withstand the that turn towards my exact location. Since, I it was just really a walking distance from we stopped, so i just agreed with him. My charge according to the meter was 96 pesos. Then when i handed my 500 pesos. He said he didnt have change. It was already 4pm. I would have understood if it was early in the morning. So I told him, "I dont have any other change kuya." And he replied with a rising tone of his voice, "You could have told me earlier". So I responded, "Kuya, you should have prepared for the change because you are the driver." And thinking of the time of the day that was.
So I went out and asked for change from a nearby store. I the taxi driver 100 pesos and he only gave me 1 peso change. 
Imagine? The inconvenience of riding his taxi without AC,busted meter,him texting while he was driving,him being rude because he didn't have change,and not even giving the exact change.
This driver is abusive. Please suspend these types of drivers.

```Tampered or broken meter, Smelly interiors```
