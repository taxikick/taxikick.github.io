### Name of taxi: Melber

Two of us disabled girls with our heavy sports equipment, boarded his taxi at the corner of Folk Arts Theatre (CCP Complex) going to Robinsons Galleria around 4:30PM Sunday. Despite his meter running, at the EDSA road approaching Roxas Blvd, he  suddenly demanded we pay extra because "matrapik". After we said no, he said we could ride the MRT at EDSA-Taft (because we did not want to pay extra.) We pointed out to him thst we passengers are both disabled, I have 1 leg and very hard to climb MRT stairs bringing our heavy things. We asked him to be more considerate to our situation. He was still very rude and argued he was 74 years old and has not made boundery yet. We said his boundery was not our problem. Our problem was he tried to jack up the fare after we're on the road. Shortly before we got down he loudly demanded if we said anything (we were talking among ourselves not to him). He was nasty rude because we refused to pay more than the meter, we didn't bother to remove the 20% discount we're entitled to. There is a law against making abusive statements and making mockery against people with disabilities (Republic Act #7277- Magna Carts for PWDs)
