### Name of taxi: Unknown

I ride a taxi in the regular metered taxi lane in NAIA Terminal 3. Halfway, the driver told me that the fare is 250/km per person, he let me check that it's already 3 km therefore amounting to 750 but I am heading to Gil Puyat, Makati. I called my sister since we both ride the taxi in the regular metered taxi lane in  Terminal 3, it's just that she was heading to Bicutan. My sister asked the driver of the taxi where she ride and the taxi driver informed her that the regular taxi metered flag down rate in Terminal 3 are all the same which is 40.  My sister told me to get his ID and to take his picture but he didn't want to. So he told me to just give him 200 and drop me in between SM Hypermarket and PNR Buendia.
