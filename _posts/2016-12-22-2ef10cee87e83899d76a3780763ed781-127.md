title: GXT222 - Cebu city (mango to b Rodriguez espina village)

### Name of taxi: Forgot :(

So eto po , our destination was from Mango near fuente osme√±a to espina village b Rodriguez st. Cebu city which is so near to our place( that's why nag taxi kami)
When we arrived to our destination , the tagalog taxi driver charged us 70php and told us that he forgot to turn on the meter so that's why he charged us with that amount only . So my cousin gave 100php . When he gave the change back, he gave 20php which my cousin didn't notice bec it's dark inside the taxi. So bale , the taxi driver was charging us 80php. 

And I want to emphasize that from mango to our destination it would only cost around 50php but that driver was overcharging us and what's more is he "forgot to turn on the meter"? WTH. 

```Over charging, No meter```
