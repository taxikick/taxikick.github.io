### Name of taxi: Didn't get it

Everytime I ride a taxi, i always double check if I can open the door from the inside. Apparently, the taxi was 'child locked', I asked the driver why I can't open, he clearly knew that the door was in 'child lock'. I immediately opened the windows, and opened the door from the outside. Good thing it was traffic, I got out immediately. Then after the driver shouted 'para kasi sa mga bata yan'! E gago ka pala eh, wala naman sasakay na batang magisa sa taxi mo at bawal ichild lock ang taxi gago ka!
