### Name of taxi: Sunflower

The taxi was third at the taxi line. We skipped the first two taxis because they were coding. After giving our destination, which was near mind you, he refused. I asked "so why are you in line"? He evaded the question and instead said "go flag down the passing cabs, not me". These asshole drivers are one of the main reasons why peole choose to go for Uber or Grab instead and taxi drivers have the audacity to complain that they're losing business. If they weren't such fuck ups then maybe people wouldn't be looking for alternatives.
