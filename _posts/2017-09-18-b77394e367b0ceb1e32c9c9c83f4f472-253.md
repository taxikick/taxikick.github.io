### Name of taxi: Envirocab

When we hailed a taxi and told us that our destination was BGC, the driver immediately told us to add an extra 50 pesos cause he was originally on his way to some area in Pasig. He was so adamant on getting us out of the vehicle when we declined, that he was slowly moving the vehicle bit by bit on our way out. Was able to take a picture of the plate number on our way out when I realized that the taxi's plate was wrong as well. It was clearly one of those "colorum" taxis.
