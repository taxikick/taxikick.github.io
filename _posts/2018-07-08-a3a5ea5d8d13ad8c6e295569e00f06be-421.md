### Name of taxi: Sandok Taxi

Driver asked immediately if I add to flag down. Told him no and it's against law. He retorted with A bawal po ba yun? And then drives rather faster and did quite sharp turns to maybe make me feel uncomfortable. Then proceeds to just drive and sound antagonistic. I felt he deliberately went the longer route so he could get a higher flag down. The whole ride, I felt insulted. No sorry or any sort of apology to me, the passenger. I tried to be polite the whole time but not rude to him.
