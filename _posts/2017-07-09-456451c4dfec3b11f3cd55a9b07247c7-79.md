title: TXH727 - Mall of asia before hypermart drop off
---

### Name of taxi: Emp

This driver cuts me on my right side while turning right going inside moa complex and he even think this is funny to suddenly steer towards my direction. I tried to confront him but he's shouting and even opening his door while slowly moving and has a passenger inside. Very rude and reckless driver. 

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
