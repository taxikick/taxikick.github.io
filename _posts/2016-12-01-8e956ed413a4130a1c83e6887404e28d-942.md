title: GXR553 - Consolaction to Mandaue City
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

My wife took a taxi from SM Consolacion, when they approached our apartment she told him to turn left into the parking area but he said he couldn't & it wasn't allowed. He said he would pull over & make my wife walk with our 2 young children (3yo & 1y9m) along with what she bought - making her cross the busy street. So instead he drove down the road to a gas station, turned around & went back. He was yelling at my wife & said he is upset, that he is a brgy official & how rich she is to act that way because she has a foreigner (me). He insulted my wife, is racist towards foreigners & made my son cry.
