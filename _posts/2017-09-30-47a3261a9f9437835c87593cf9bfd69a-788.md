title: UWM430 - SM NORTH TAXI BAY
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

It was raining this afternoon around 1:45pm. We were waiting at the taxi bay of SM north when this taxi was on the taxi lane, then ask if where are we heading. Then told him, we are heading to Sauyo-Bagbag, Novaliches QC. He refuses and drives away. We thought taxi dont have the right to refuse to any destination? If he is not on duty on his taxi why ask us where are we going and fall in line on the taxi bay? I hope our complaint reaches the authority to punish this kind of drivers.

```Refused boarding```
