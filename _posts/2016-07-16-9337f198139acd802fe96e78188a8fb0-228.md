### Name of taxi: EFE Taxi

I rode the taxi from Eton Centris to Antipolo at 7:32 AM July 16, 2016, before going inside the taxi I have asked the driver first if he's okay with my destination and he agreed. Upon reaching Antipolo, he noticed that there were slow-moving cars in the other side of the way and he started throwing tantrums (not to mention scratching his head, pinapalo yung manibela, driving recklessly) and keep on blaming me that my destination was too far and that I was the one causing his day unlucky. I would like to make a point that I'm the type of person who usually give big tips to the drivers, so I have set my mind to give him 50 pesos to 100 pesos tip but then the rude behavior that he showed less likely gave me the reason not to tip him. He doesn't even worth every penny that I hardly earn. What's bothering me most is that why most of the taxi drivers hired in the reputable company taxis were rude? This is not my first time to ride in a company taxi, I never complained in the authorities but this one is an exemption.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
