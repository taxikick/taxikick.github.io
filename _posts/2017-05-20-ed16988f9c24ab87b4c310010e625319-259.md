title: ACD2642 - From Bonifacio Global Tower to Market Market
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Usual rate is 60-70 pesos but this old driver with no meter charged us exactly 100; when questioned why he has no meter, he did not answer and just said its the usual rate; he looked mentally challenged because he mumbling by himself throughout the short trip; he even asked if we will be withdrawing money on our destination which is irrelevant... he looked like he is on drugs

```Over charging, No meter```
