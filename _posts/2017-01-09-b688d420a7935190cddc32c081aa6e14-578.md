### Name of taxi: Brheynan Taxi

I was actually about to ride a bus to have a consultation in MMC. Apparently, busses are full. And since taxis are flocking in front of  GA Tower, I decided to ride cab instead. Then when I was inside, he locked the taxi and made our way. Only few meters away, he told me that he needs to add 30 because there's heavy traffic there. So, I agreed.just to avoid conversation even I could clearly see (even the waze) that EDSA is really fine at that moment. To my surprise, we didn't took the EDSA instead, he went to a longer way. To cut the story short, my trip was amounted to 150 even the meter says 100 only. I don't really want to use taxis anymore. That man is horrible.
