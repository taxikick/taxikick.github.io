### Name of taxi: Unknown

A looks familiar Taxi driver with different cab, so eto kakasakay ko pa lang, banat nya pa lang, "metro-han na kita sir, ikaw na bahala", I'm just in silent. Then when we were already in Macapagal, nagpa-gas pa, nagbuhos ng tubig pa sa radiator, which added P10 to my fare, pinagbigyan ko, then we already arrived at Okada, total was P112, I hand him P120, and funny and surprising, he's disappointed, "dagdagan mo naman P50, walang pasahero dito", then I said, "o, nagpa-gas ka na nga eh, mgpapadagdag ka pa?" then he said, "kahit ibang taxi pre lugi dito pg ganito malayo, walang masasakay", I replied "Eh araw2 ako pumupunta dito, ikaw lang nagrereklamo ng ganyan, at saka nasakyan na kita dati, kilala na kita (with different style of haggling). Then when I got out of the cab, sumagot pa "Ahh ganun ba, di na rin kita isasakay".

This one deserved to be banned for driving a cab and having a license.
