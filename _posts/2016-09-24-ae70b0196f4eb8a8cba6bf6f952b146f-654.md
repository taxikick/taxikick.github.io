title: AAZ2918 - Capitol Medical Center
---

### Name of taxi: Green Taxi

We are headed to Capitol Medical Center with our 18 month old baby. On the way, he speeds up a lot even if there were a lot of cars in front as if he's on a race. We're already outside Capitol Medical Center, not yet reaching the entrance, when there were a slight traffic which I think is due to the parking entrance in the right side of the street. The taxi keeps on complaining about it nonstop and keeps on horning that's why we got pissed off and just decided to get out of the taxi. Our fare is at P72 pesos, P82 from the meter minus the P10, we gave him P100 and then told him to just give us P20 as change, then he reasoned out that we are his 2nd passenger that's why he has no change for it.
