### Name of taxi: MIKE MYX

From Makati Cinema Square we rode this Taxi going to Victory Liner Pasay. Tumatakbo na yung taxi but still in Makati nang mapansin namin na hindi umaandar ang metro. My friend told the driver na yung metro hindi nakaandar. The driver then asked us to just pay 200 pesos. I told him mag metro nalang at mahal yan kasi malapit lang yung Victory Liner. He insisted kasi daw traffic. Then my friend signaled that she was a bit nervous. Then the driver asked us if we can pay him 150. Then my friend signaled na pumayag nalang kami kasi natatakot sya since dalawa kaming babae. So pumayag kami. Then 5mins without any traffic nakarating na kami sa terminal. I just told the driver wile handing him the money na "God bless you Kuya". I'd like to complain about this driver please.

```Over charging, No meter```
