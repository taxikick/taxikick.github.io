### Name of taxi: Unknown

July 19, 2018 at  4:30-5pm, Tramo area in front of NAIA3. My friends and I decided to ride taxi to EDSA LRT due to flood. It was supposed to be 5-10 minutes ride only.  The taxi driver said to add 50 on our fare. He even took different route that is too far from our destination. While driving, he kept on texting and talking to someone on his cellphone. In addition to that, he doesn't drive smoothly. 

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
