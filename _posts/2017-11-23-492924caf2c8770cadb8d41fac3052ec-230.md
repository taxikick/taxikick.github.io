### Name of taxi: SANVICENTE TAXI SOMETHING 

at around 3:30 pm i rode a taxi from ayala mall to mabolo church only ... as and to my surprise the meter was Php 96.00 .. ( without traffic) i then reacted saying that hes meter is impossible!!! he answered very rudlely saying isnt that clear to u that the meter its Php 96.00 !!! since  i was in a hurry , i was force to pay him Php 100 and he did not even give me any change. i am pretty sure he tampered hes meter becuase i ride everyday all the time and it couldve just cost around Php 70.00 or below. hence in that eveving i ride a taxi going back home and thats from Sm city cebu to Castle Peak hotel kasambagan which is even more further distance comepared to ayala mall to mabolo church and my meter was only Php 75.00 (SM MALL TO CASTLEPEAK HOTEL ). i hope u  could catch this rude and dishonest driver and do something. Thank you 

Fyi: the driver did not even give change of Php 4.00 cus i have him Php100 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
