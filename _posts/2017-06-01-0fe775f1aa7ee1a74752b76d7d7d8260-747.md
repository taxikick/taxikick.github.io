### Name of taxi: Unknown

My wife and I picked up a taxi from Scout Chuatoco Street going to Scout Rallos Street, Quezon City. When we arrived at our destination, we noticed that the driver didn't start the meter count. He asked us for 60 pesos where in the usual rate is 50 or less since the destination is just a few blocks away from the starting point. Then, after we refused to pay the said amount he was asking, he got angry and started raising his voice. 

```Over charging, No meter```
