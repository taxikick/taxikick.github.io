title: UWE342 - Cubao -drop off
---

### Name of taxi: Not sure

My friend and I rode the cab from Eastwood City to Cubao. We informed the driver that our destinations are Gateway and Farmers which is just a few steps away. Interiors are old and smelly and we had to ask the driver to increase the temp of the Aircon as it was hard to breathe  He asked if we cab take Katipuna route but we refused bec it was traffc the same way using B serrano. When we reached Gateway, he asked both of us to step out since there is a passenger looking for a cab. Driver knew onset that the last drop off was at Farmers. Very rude driver! Uneducated ill-manerred hypocrite.

```Rude behavior, Smelly interiors```
