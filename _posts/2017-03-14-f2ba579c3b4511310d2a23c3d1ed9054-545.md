title: WH711 - Boni Barangka to Santolan Pasig
---

### Name of taxi: Davis

I ride the taxi from Boni - Hulo to be exact, the taxi stop from the nearest gasoline station while the meter is running so it cost me already 15 pesos. Then when the car is already running, the rider suddenly adjusted the seat near him and put his arm to it that covers the meter. He is timely adjusting the sounds of his audio, and every time he do it the meter suddenly increases rapidly. This is the 1st time i pay 200 php and still I'm not yet on my house, which still 10 km far. I choose to drop on the nearest highway to avoid paying more than 200 php. The normal amount i pay for it is from 170 to 180 php

```Tampered or broken meter, Not in uniform```
