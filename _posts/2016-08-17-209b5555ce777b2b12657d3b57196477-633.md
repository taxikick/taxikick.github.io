title: UWN80 - in between megamall and st francis square
---

### Name of taxi: 

I would like to file a complaint against these drivers with plate numbers:

UWN 805,UYB 868, AAI 2231, UWH 322, UWH 841, UWE 526, WQR 806, AAW 3688, UWN 359, UVS 335 and UVG 951

Last night, they were all parked in between megamall and st. francis square even if parking was not allowed. Also, instead of helping people to get home the were all ganging up on people for a much higher fare, in my case I was asked to pay for 300 pesos (megamall to cubao) which typically only cost me about 100 pesos.

I even asked for the help of the police patrol who was staying in the area and they told me that they will do something about it but instead they just stayed on the same spot without any actions at all.

PS: I took some photos and a video.

Hope you can do something about this. Thank you and God bless.
