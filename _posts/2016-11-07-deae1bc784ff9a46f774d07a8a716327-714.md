title: UWJ-339 - BGC Taguig

### Name of taxi: Luke Matthew Transport

My meter charge from Pasig to BGC is php117. I gave php150 and the driver gave me php20. I  looked at him as if asking why he only gave me php20 but i didnt say a word. He reached for some coins and rudely handed it to me that some of the coins fell on the floor. He didnt even say sorry and that really got into my nerves. I counted the coins, he gave php7. I told him its still not enough. He got mad and attempted to return the php50 saying he dont have coins anymore. I declined and got off the cab. By the way, i asked him to drop me off the taxi drop-off in Market-market but he just let me get off the taxi while the stoplight is red.
