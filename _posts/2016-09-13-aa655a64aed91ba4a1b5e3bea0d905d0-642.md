### Name of taxi: MAx.CAP 5

We tried to go to domestic airport terminal 4 from makati ave. Then the driver gave us a note charging 2700peso and we refused. He ketp on driving without stopping and the door was locked even stoppage at the traffic siganal. I grabed his both hand and got out while the car was stopping during traffic signal

```Over charging, No meter```
