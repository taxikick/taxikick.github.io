### Name of taxi: Unknown

The driver refused to use the meter upon driving to my destination, he instead charged me 100% above my usual regular fare, it turns out he was contracting. However when I refused to pay, he locked the doors for me to be obliged to pay the amount, so I paid due to fear.

```Over charging, No meter```
