### Name of taxi: NA

The Taxi driver was very suspicious, he kept looking at us in the rear view mirror and was quite strange when it came to the direction. We felt light headed after getting off. Perhaps was using ammonia. Good thing we rolled down the window. Along with that, the driver was pretty reckless, stepping hard on the breaks and driving really fast.
