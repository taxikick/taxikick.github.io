### Name of taxi: MIE

Hello, i took this taxi yesterday morning from cebu city pier to fuente osmena. When we arrived at destination the driver asked me 100 pesos but the price on the meter was only 64 pesos. He overcharged me, and when I complain for that he was really rude at me. It was really early in the morning, I didn't feel safe and didn't want to have trouble so I paid 100 pesos instead of 64

```Over charging```
