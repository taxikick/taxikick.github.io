### Name of taxi: AYU

9:17pm We ride in the taxi then the driver looking at me many times, I'm thinking why he looking like that then when I saw the meter it's 41 already but still we are not starting to move,. I don't want to talk to him about that maybe he needs more money, then I said go to guisad road. Then he still looking at me then I make my eyes stay looking at the meter. Cause I know what his thinking. 

```Over charging, No flag down of meter```
