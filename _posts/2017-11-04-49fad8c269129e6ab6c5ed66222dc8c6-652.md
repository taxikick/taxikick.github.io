title: 137705 - Crossing Shang to Megamall Pedestrian
---

### Name of taxi: NA

Taxi is turning right to shangrila and the pedestrians stopped to have the taxi go first. When the taxi already drove past the pedestrian, it stopped and tried to do drive in reverse. The pedestrians were hit by this maneuver but luckily no one is hurt. Hope the driver gets what he deserve as punishment. He knows that there were pedestrians crossing and yet still he decided to do this reckless act.

```Reckless driving```
