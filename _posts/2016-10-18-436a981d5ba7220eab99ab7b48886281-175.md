### Name of taxi: Unknown

Carrying a lot of stuff so took a taxi. Finally, after 20 mins waiting,Taxi with said plate number entered taxi lane. destination was in ortigas center only (escriva) but he didnt want to take me in and told me to go to another taxi lane (what the heck!!) and moved his taxi forward WHILE HIS CAR DOOR WAS STILL OPEN. If he wanted to choose his route then he shoulnt have entered the taxi lane!
