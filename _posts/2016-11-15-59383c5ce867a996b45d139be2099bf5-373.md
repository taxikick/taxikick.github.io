### Name of taxi: RHEV TAXI

 I feel very disappointed about the taxi driver here.
When I get in the taxi with my friend,the driver doesn't press the meter,after I remind him,he says he has to pay parking ticket because he is parking his car outside of the hotel waiting line,so he asks us pay 100pesos and doesn't use the meter.
I think he is the one choose to pay money for himself to get customers,he shouldn't ask us to pay for him also it's just a short distance from Pea Rd 1 pasay city to 5 Diosdado Macapagal Blvd.
So I reject his request and tell him we would like to pay more if he uses the meter.
I can't believer he talking to us very rude even asks us get out. I think because he knows today is raining day and we are not local.
I believe I'm not the only person experienced this.
I sincerely hope I can get help.
Hope this kind of things will stop,it will bring this country bad reputation.thanks
