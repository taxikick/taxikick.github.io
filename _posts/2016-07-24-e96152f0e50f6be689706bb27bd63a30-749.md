title: TYT211 - Manila Airport 
---

### Name of taxi: ?

Taxi (and accomplice) standing at pillar 19 at Manila Airport. Seemed normal at first until they kept nagging and nagging me to sign a form about service satisfaction or something before I even arrived. Additionally they kept telling me to pay before we arrived again and again stating that there was a fixed fee as it was a airport service????? No way. Cost 2500 for a 30 minute drive which should have been a 5 minute drive at most as my hotel was right next to the airport, I checked on the map. Additionally there were no details in the car or a metre ? I asked about the metre and they said no metre as if it was normal ? I made sure to get the numberplate when I left (TYT211) but I did pay as I feared for my safety. There was also no uniform or receipt. Quite unhappy, happened around 4am.  

```Over charging, No meter```
