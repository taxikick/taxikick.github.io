title: TXV697 - From NAIA terminal 1
---

### Name of taxi: Carlos Taxi

Our colleague from Australia reported this incident. She arrived at the NAIA terminal 1 and took this taxi from the airport to her destination in QC, where we arranged lodging for her.  She had to sit in the front seat because the driver told her that her luggage couldn't fit in the trunk and had to be placed in the backseat. Almost immediately he started asking her all sorts of questions and telling her about his life, including his sexual experiences.  Eventually he started touching her arm, kissing her hands and tried to get closer physically.  Our friend was frozen due to shock and contemplated jumping from the vehicle.  He took her on a roundabout way, the ride fron the airport took them 5 hours.  He kept asking if she wanted to stop somewhere with him.  When they arrived at her lodging, he tried to go up with her to her room; of course she completely refused and immediately appealed for help from the staff of the lodging area.  Fortunately, which was stupid of him, he gave his personal mobile number and told her to call him anytime if she wanted company. His number is 09154086456.  This asshole should not be driving and should be put in jail immediately.
