### Name of taxi: -

We were 5 riding the taxi at SM Manila and right when we went inside he told us that we were 6 but we were only 5. He said it was overloading but still continued to drive and harassed us to pay additional fee. We could have gotten down instead but he was driving so we could not do so. We ride taxi going home everyday and the meter only ranges from 56 to 64 however his meter went up to 68 then told us to 50. Noticeably he was driving slow even though there was no traffic. We only added 20. He was obviously a professional in harassing passengers. Yes we were many so he should have not accepted us. If he was not rude we would have not reported but he was even texting while driving.
