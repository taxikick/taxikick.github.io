### Name of taxi: Unknown 

I know it's my words against his words. I will start with our conversations. 
D- san ka?
Me- katipunan po, sa sta clara
D- ilan kayo?
Me- 4
D- plus 50 lang
Me- bakit plus 50? Di ba metered taxi kayo?
D- plus 50 na talaga ngayon?
Me- kelan pa? Sige kuya wag na lang. pero i will confirm sa ltfrb kung plus 50 na talaga sa taxi. 

Then barker in that area saw us arguing. He told the driver that no plus 50 policy implemented and I know that too. Then taxi driver left the area. And i got the chance to took photo of his taxi.
