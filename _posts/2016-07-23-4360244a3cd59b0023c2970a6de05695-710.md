### Name of taxi: Dont remember. Twas a grab taxi though

We wanted to ride a taxi to lantaw srp. He refused and said he would only go there if we'd pay him additional 50 pesos on top of the fare. I am appalled since this is the first time i experienced this in cebu.

```Refused boarding, Contracting```
