### Name of taxi: I forgot the taxi name

The taxi was taken earlier by my wife's coworkers along nfa loakan road and boarded along woodlane liwanag loakan and waited for us. I am at the front seat and saw him texting while driving. Also, driver is not wearing his seatbelt. My wife's coworkers dropped by at PNR Victory Liner, So I transfered the back seat together with my wife and continued boarding. Upon reaching our destination at Baguio cathedral, taxi meter reading is 109 pesos, so i handed him 105 pesos instead of 104 due to the less 5pesos taxi rule, the taxi driver said in tagalog "kulang pa ng 4pesos" then my wife handed another 5 pesos. After that he still keeps on talking and saying "dapat nga plus 35pesos pa yan dahil nagusap kami ng mga kasama nyo...and so on." but we got down. He never said those things earlier till the trip ends and acts rudely. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
