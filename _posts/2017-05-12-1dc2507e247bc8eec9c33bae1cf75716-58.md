### Name of taxi: Charity Faith Trans

I and my 2 year old son got off from a provicial bus and there's this taxi along with other taxis lined up in a bridge near Gil Puyat LRT Station. It was around 6 PM. He asked, San kayo? I told him, Sa Avenida kuya. He answered, 400. 400???? Gil Puyat to Avenida 400?? He bargained, sige 300 na lang. I said, metro lang kuya, dagdagan ko na lang. Hindi raw. Traffic raw. May ginagawa raw sa Recto. I took a picture of his taxi and even him coz I'm planning to report him. But he said hindi raw sa kanyang taxi yun and turned away. Halatang umiiwas. May question is, kung hindi sa kanya yun dapat hindi yun ang una sa pila at hindi sya nakikipag usap sakin. Kaya I know that is his taxi which I took a picture of.
