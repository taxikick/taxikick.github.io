### Name of taxi: Unknown

I ride a taxi in Technohub Quezon City, the driver is recklessly driving. Then when we reached my destination he started cursing me non stop for i don’t know what the reason is. I gave him 100 php for a fare of 75 php. He continue cursing and don’t want to give my change. I asked him my change cause he’s so rude and still cursing. He’s not stopping the car and continue moving. I asked for my change again and he gave me 20 php but he’s still cursing me. I asked for the remaining 5 php and asked him to stop the car. He did not stop until he saw another taxi infront of him. Please give me a feedback of this driver. I’ll file charges. 

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
