### Name of taxi: Not sure

We came out of the Taoist temple and a group of men on the street were trying to sell sightseeing tours to the temple of Leah and Tops lookout. We said no thanks as we were just looking for a taxi somewhere (we hadn't decided where to go at that stage). 

As taxis stopped and we asked them to take us to the Temple of Leah, one of the group of men would shout things to the drivers and they would then refuse to take us unless we paid them 800 pesos. This driver did the same once we're in the cab. He then showed us a red folder with images of the Temple of Leah and Tops Lookout in it and said he was unable to take us on the meter as it was too steep. He said he'd take us for 1,500 pesos and refused several times to turn on the meter. 

We got out of the cab and I took a photo of his license plate/car before walking away. He saw me doing so and drove at me as if he was going to run me over so I had to jump up onto the curb. He then rolled his window down and shouted at me "do you want to bite me?" Twice. He took off his seatbelt as if he were going to get out of the car to 'fight' me I think.  We continued to walk away and left him behind.
