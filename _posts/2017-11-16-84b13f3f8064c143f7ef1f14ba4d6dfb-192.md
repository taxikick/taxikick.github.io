### Name of taxi: BDKC 


Nov.,15 2017, around 2:30PM, my wife rode the said taxi cab accompanied by her mother and a yaya together with my 6 yr old and 1 1/2 yr old sons. My son's stroller was brought and placed at the taxi's back compartment. They arrived in Riverbank and all had already stepped down out of the taxi, they requested the taxi driver to open it's back compartment but instead the taxi driver sped away immediately inspite of my wife's tapping the cab and shouting at the driver. we don't want to think that this is intentional or not. But Mr. taxi Driver, please coordinate thru Barangay Duyan-duyan with Tel. No. 421-90-80,  c/o Barangay Kagawad Andy S. Gonzales or Barangay Secretary Thea Acejas.
