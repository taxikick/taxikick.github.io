title: 997CCE - pier 4 cebu to USC talamban Cebu
---

### Name of taxi: Nikkan Taxi

We boarded the taxi near roble office at pier 4 in which the driver was covering the meter using his bought newspaper so we could not notice that the meter is already running which is for the previous passenger. It was only we noticed at past robinsons mall in pier 4 that the meter was already at 85.00. The driver told us that he will just deduct 20.00 as it was still from the previous passenger. However, the meter arriving at USC talamban was already 176.50. Which means if he would only deduct 20.00, it would now only 156.50 which is way off our usual fee from pier 4 to talamban. He did not even had a flag down

```Over charging, No flag down of meter```
