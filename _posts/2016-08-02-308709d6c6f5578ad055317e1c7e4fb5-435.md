### Name of taxi: Kenosis Taxi

While handing over the exact fare of Php 166, I politely asked whether the taxi's meter was working properly or not. Made a short comment about the bill not reaching the said amount after taking a cab multiple times to drive us from Megamall to Vista Verde. The driver instantly flared up and aggressively offered a receipt. After a momentary pause, he started shouting and threateningly asked us for our names. Told us that he plans to write down our names on his copy of the receipt. Before shutting the door on his face, my sister told him in a firm voice that our names were none of his business. The red-faced elderly man continued shouting and in an attempt to pacify him, I walked over and opened the passenger door at the back. He was still ranting when the same sibling came up and told him that there was no chance of him getting what he wanted. Needless to say, that driver threw us a dirty and threatening look as  he drove away. Guess having his meter questioned and not getting any tips pissed the hell out of him.
