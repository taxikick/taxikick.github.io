### Name of taxi: Golden Boy/Te

So I was supposed to pay only 180 cause I have a student discount which clearly was stated on the window. My taxi driver got so angry and started yelling at me saying that there is no school anymore (even though there is) and he sarcastically said to not pay and get out. I still ended up paying but the price he demanded so he wonâ€™t shout anymore.
