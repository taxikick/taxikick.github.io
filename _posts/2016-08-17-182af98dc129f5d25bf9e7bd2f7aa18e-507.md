### Name of taxi: Celynn Taxi

around 7:45 pm

Last night, with a friend, we came from Fairview Terraces and rode a taxi that was waiting outside. Since both of us were from Lagro, we always go home together but having me nearer, tends for me to be dropped-off first.

What happened was, as soon as I was off from that taxi, still with my friend/colleague inside, it zoomed immediately and nearly slammed to another car (one of those cars parked inside the subdivision). Thank goodness that he was able to reach his home but when he stepped down and circled around the taxi's tail part, the taxi moved backward and bumped him and hit his left part (mostly his hip). Luckily, he has a big backpack dangling on his side, or else a big bruise might be evident by now. My friend tapped the trunk to give the driver a sign that he just hit him, but it just zoomed again and even in a faster speed.

The taxi driver is just too careless and an accident waiting to happen.
