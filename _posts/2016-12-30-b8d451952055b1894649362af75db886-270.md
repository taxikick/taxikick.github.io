### Name of taxi: not able to get

We are boarding from Market Market Taxi stand. The security guard provided us a ticket with taxi's plate number. When we board the taxi, we said that the destination is pasay rotonda but he needs to drive along Ayala because one of us will have to get off and the other one will go to Pasay Rotonda. The driver said "mag BGC natayo labas ng Kalayaan matraffic sa Edsa" I said " paano ung kelangan bumaba sa Ayala?" Sabi ng driver bumaba nalang din sa Pasay Rotonda at mag byahe nlang let pabalik. Kung ayaw nyo sumakay kayo sa iba." I said may ordinance na bawal pumili ng pasahero lalo na pumila ka dito sa mall. Sabi nya "wala akong pakelam bumaba nlang kau." i was about to hit the driver but my companion stopped me and said ireport nlang. So we get off the taxi and report it to the guard station there. We said ayaw mag sakay kasi daw matraffic sa destination na dadaanana. Kinuha ni guard ung ticket where he wrote the plate number and ibinagay sa iba. at sabi ni guard sakay nlang kayo sa iba. My companion said "kuya guard wala ka gagawin sa taxi driver na un? or ireport man lang or kahit sabihan man lang." the guard replied. Sakop the taguig police yan di sakin. We said sa guard "ano silbi mo dyan mag sulat lang ng ng plate number? the guard did not replied. We ride another taxi because we are about to be late to work.  

Please Help..
