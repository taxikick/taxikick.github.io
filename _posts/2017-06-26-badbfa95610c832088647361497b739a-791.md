title: UWA253 - Rosario Pasig City
---

### Name of taxi: Adlaon taxi

Normally my trip from Rosario Pasig to East Rembo, Makati ranges from 89-96pesos (that's with traffic already). However, I noticed that from my starting point to Pasig Rotonda the meter is already at 64.50 (which normally would be 57pesos). I told the driver that his meter is fast, but he ignored me. The moment I arrived my destination my bill was 106 (there was no traffic encountered, and we weren't even stopped by any traffic lights)

```Tampered or broken meter, Smelly interiors```
