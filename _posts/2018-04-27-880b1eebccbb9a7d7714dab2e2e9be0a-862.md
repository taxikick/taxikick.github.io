### Name of taxi: Didn't noticed it since I was focused on the plate number

When we arrive in NAIA 3, the total fare is 218. I gave him 220 but the taxi driver demanded it should be 250. I'm in a hurry and have no time to argue and I don't want stupid things to happen so I gave him what he demanded and just noted down the plate number.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
