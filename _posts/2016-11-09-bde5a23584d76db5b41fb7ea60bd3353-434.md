title: ATA5440 - QC to Aseana One
---

### Name of taxi: Richmelyn

I rode a taxi with the intention of not getting late. I just told him that we should head to Aseana One and he just circled his way through Nagtahan then Osmena ending up in the traffic jam area of EDSA Pasay.

This had wasted my time and I was charged more than expected because usually drivers will take the Rixas BLVD route.

I don't know why he did this but this has to STOP!
