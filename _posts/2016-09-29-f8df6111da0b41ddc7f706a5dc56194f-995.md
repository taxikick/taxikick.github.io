title: UVG51 - From NAIA to Roxas Blvd
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

We hailed a taxi in NAIA to bring us to Megamall but instead he dropped us off at Roxas Blvd. Also he told us to pay 150 for the whole trip even if the taxi meter only said it was only for 60 pesos.

```Over charging, No meter```
