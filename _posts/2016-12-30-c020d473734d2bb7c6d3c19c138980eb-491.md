### Name of taxi: Can't remember

Before the driver let me in, he seems hesitant to let me board and was telling me that the my destination which is Ortigas is where he just came from and mentioned that he was about to go on a break or park in a garage or something.  I was already inside the cab when I noticed that the driver did not turn on the meter. I immediately told the driver that I will pay by the meter then he told me that I should pay him 150 pesos. I refused and told the driver that it's too much compared from the usual price from that place to my destination. I'm already aware of the price range because I take a cab everyday to work. Suddenly driver said he will just transfer me. Driver parked the cab and then dropped me off. I came late because of what happened.

```Refused boarding, Contracting```
