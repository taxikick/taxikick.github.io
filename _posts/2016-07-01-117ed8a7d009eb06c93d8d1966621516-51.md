### Name of taxi: LBR

THE DRIVER ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL FARE BECAUSE HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MY DESTINATION WAS BUT THEN HE SUGGESTED AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE AND THAT ROUTE IS WITHIN A SKETCHY AREA THAT NOT WELL LIT AND BARELY PASSED BY SO I SAID NO, AND I WAS FIRM ABOUT THE ROUTE I ORIGINALLY TOLD HIM TO GO THROUGH. AND THE FUCKING CAB SMELLED LIKE BEER 

```Smelly interiors, Malicious mischief```
