### Name of taxi: 20th Avenue

At around 10:30 p.m. October 30, 2017 we went to taxi stand at Mall of Asia, we ask the driver to take us to Baclaran and the driver immediately rejected us and arrogantly told he is only going to Bacoor, Cavite as he was insisting that he is going home. The driver was very rude. We told him that we will report him to the police and he rudely he answered "isama ko pa daw siya sa police"
