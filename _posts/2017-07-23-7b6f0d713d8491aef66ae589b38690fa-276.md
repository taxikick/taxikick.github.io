### Name of taxi: Mid valley

The taxi driver was at the back of the jeepney that I am in. We are in the pedestrian lane and the driver of the jeepney that I am in was waiting for the jeepney infront to move forward since there are still passengers who are coming out from the jeepney. The taci driver was rushing and keeps on horning. When our jeepney already left the taxi wasn't able to move because people are crossing the road. I think he was annoyed by the fact that the passengers stared at him ang got angry because of the non stop horning he does. After letting the pedestrians cross the road, he chased our jeepney and he attempted to collide with our jeepney good tjing that the jeepney driver was aware was able to avoid the accident. We, the passengers was so upset and was nervous. The jeepney driver trued to chase the taxi but he was too fast that we weren't able to see him already. We can see in his face that he was really angry because the passengers of the jeep was straing badly at him. I think he needs to be penalize because of that

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
