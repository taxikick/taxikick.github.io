### Name of taxi: None of the above

I checked in on his cab. Everything is well at first. I gave him navigation to where exactly he should be going until he reached the traffic zone. He wrecklessly drove the car like he was about to bump with another car. I felt dizzy and fainted and I asked him if he is ok because i dont feel well on how he drive. 

He didn't respond on my question. When we reached the destination, I was looking for an exact amount to pay on my metered fare. I got negative 5 pesos on the amount and I asked him if it is ok. He then answered me in rude manner like "Cge na! Ok na yan! Di ko naman ikayayaman yan!"
