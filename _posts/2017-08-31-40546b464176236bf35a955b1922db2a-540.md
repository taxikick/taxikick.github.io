### Name of taxi: did not see

im looking for a taxi since 8:30am but couldn't find one. then this taxi came with no passenger so i hurriedly approached the taxi, and told him my destination will be robinson otis (where in fact this is just close to my pick up point 10-15 min ride usually) then i dont kbow if his pretending not to know where otis is, (seriously, considering himself as a taxi driver?) #LTFRB ??? so i said its going to UN, then this mister asked for additional 50pesos, driver: "plus 50?" ?! so i said "kaya kayo di sinasakyan e" and close the door. 

i dont know what's up to philippines, its really frustrating to have this kind of countrymen/ people, in other country whenever i travel abroad we ride and sit in the taxi first before they ask for your destination, however in the philippines the only place that is really frustrating that they will ask for you destination first prior getting in the taxi. 

taxi companies always complain about having Uber and GRAB?! they cant complain because of their drivers attitude. how can we commuters would want to ride taxis if they always act this way. 

where in fact, whenever we ride taxi here in metro they dont usually give us the right amount or exact change.

i really hope that LTFRB will make some actions to all our complains about taxis.
