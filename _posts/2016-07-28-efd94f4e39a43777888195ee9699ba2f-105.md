title: AAO8307 - Glorietta 4 taxi bay
---

### Name of taxi: 

Around 7:30am the cab stopped infront of us. He just placed his window down and asked where are we headed. I've told him that we are headed to edsa-kalayaan towards bgc which is few blocks away from glorietta 4 and it could reach it for only 5 mins but he just ignored us and speed off. I could easily forgive him if he declined politely.
