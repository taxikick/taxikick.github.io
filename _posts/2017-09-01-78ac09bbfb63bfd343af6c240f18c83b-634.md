### Name of taxi: Unknown

He picked us up and didn't inform us that he doesn't have change for 100 php we decided to ride a taxi since it was around 2 am and we don't want to walk; the destination is very near and we should be paying around 50-60 php. then when we arrived he said he doesn't have smaller bill and we gave him 100 pesos and he didn't gave the change. this is a crime!!!!!!!!!!!!! as per the law they are not allowed to do this is is a clear violation and falls on estafa and even extortion. We involuntarily paid for almost half of our fare and we even gone through all the trouble to look for anyone who can change our 100 php since we only have a several of 100,500 and 1000 bill and our change was only 35 php which is not enough for our 57php fare. If he is not punished for his wrongful doing I will make sure to take legal matters I don't want to sit wait for another bastard of a taxi driver to do this to someone else or to me again.
