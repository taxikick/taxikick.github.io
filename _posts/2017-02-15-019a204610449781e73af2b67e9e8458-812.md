### Name of taxi: Unknown

Taxi drivers wants an additional PHP20 even the destination is so near (Mckinley to Signal Village). Taxi force my GF to add 20 but when she refuse and wants to transfer to other taxi in line, the taxi driver rudely raise the volume of stereo and run fast like no tomorrow. 

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
