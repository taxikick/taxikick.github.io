### Name of taxi: Not captured

Driver forcefully starts the trip without using the meter. Driver will demmand a fare rate beyond acceptable and will charge you parking fee even though he was just waiting on the road. Very rude and demmanding. My trip was less than a kilometer away but asking for doubled amount.

```Over charging, No meter```
