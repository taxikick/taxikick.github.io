### Name of taxi: Francisco vargas

Living in a condo unit, i asked the guard to call a cab as i was getting ready to go down to the lobby.  When i recieved the confirmation from the guard i went down to the lobby. It took me less than 2 minutes to go down but in that short amount of time the taxi driver was already charging me P50.50 . So I questioned the validity of the driver's meter but he insisted it was right. Being skeptical, i asked more details but then to my surprise he got offended, stopped the car and told me to get out and look for another taxi. Then words were exchanged out of frustration.

```Choosing passengers, No meter```
