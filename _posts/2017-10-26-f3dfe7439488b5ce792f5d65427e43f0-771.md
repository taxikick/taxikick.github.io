### Name of taxi: Lady Lyn

I take a cab going home to Onyx St. from BGC everyday at around 2am. The meter shows 117 pesos on average. However for this particular ride, the meter hit 145 pesos despite the lack of any irregularities. Traffic at this time was never an issue, nor was the route taken (Jupiter to Nakar). When we reached Onyx St., I noticed the meter increasing at a much faster rate than usual. It increased from 120 to 145 in less than 2 minutes with less than a kilometer travelled. I told the driver his meter appears to be broken but he did not respond. I paid the amount due and took note of the taxi's name and plate number.

```Tampered or broken meter```
