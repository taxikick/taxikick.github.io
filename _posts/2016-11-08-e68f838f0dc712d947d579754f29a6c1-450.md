### Name of taxi: Roadrunner taxi

Said paknaan sa sun pride when we got in the taxi, he replied Mandaue? And we said yes. Then he ask again where too when we in Mandaue and we said to be more complete, Sto. Nino Village. He then start driving us to Banilad and when we complain to him he got angry and said we should have give him the complete adress. Cant be more complete as I see it. This doesn't Ground for misunderstandings as the communication was done in bisaya. 

```Rude behavior, Out of line```
