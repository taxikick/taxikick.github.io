### Name of taxi: Ronnan Raven

At the NAIA Terminal 2, taxi driver was hesitant to let me in because he was from Cavite and I was going to Quezon City. The person managing the taxi queue was able to convince him anyway but up until Pioneer he told me that he will transfer me to another taxi because he might caught due to a "car ban". The taxi driver told me to pay him the meter amount minus 40 pesos and transfer to another taxi of a "kakilala". I refused and just got down at Boni and flagged down another taxi.
