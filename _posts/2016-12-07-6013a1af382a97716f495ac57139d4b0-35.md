### Name of taxi: LBR taxi

We waited for a taxi at the Medical City taxi lane after the treatment.  We rode this taxi.  I said that we are going to antipolo.  The taxi driver wanted to us to add 100 pesos and his reason is because it is already a provincial area.  We refuse at first and said that we rode a taxi to have a cheaper transpo.  Expense..  The driver still insist to add additional amount for at least 50 pesos or he will make us dismount his taxi. We just agreed to avoid comfrontation.  I read the passenger bill of rights.  And i must say this driver is a reckless driver.  He's driving while talking on the phone, the inside of the taxi have a smell of cigarette and driving fast when there is no traffic.  He also doesn't display his license.
