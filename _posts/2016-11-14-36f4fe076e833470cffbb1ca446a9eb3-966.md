### Name of taxi: Unknown

We rode a taxi from Eastwood to Antipolo. My wallet only has 2 paper bills, one is a P100 peso bill and the other one is a P1000 peso bill. 
When we arrived at our destination, I pulled out a bill which I thought was only P100. Since our meter only reads P141, my boyfriend added P50. When my boyfriend gave it to the driver, he opened his lights in the front seat and checked our payment. Since my boyfriend also thought that I handed a P100, he just gave it to him. Turns out when we got home, I pulled out the P1000 bill. We actually gave him a P1050 but he did not say anything, he just took a U-turn quickly and escaped.
