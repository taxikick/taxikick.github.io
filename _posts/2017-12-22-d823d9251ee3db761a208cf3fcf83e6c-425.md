### Name of taxi: Laude

While his 1st passenger where still unloading his car, he opened his window and asked for our location, when i told him where we're going, he refused to take us and i asked him why when in fact he can see us carrying a 5mos old infant and a bag of grocery plastic. He paused for a while looking like he was thinking what to answer why he refused, then answered he still needs to eat, it was 4pm and its still too early for dinner.then he drove off.. 

```Refused boarding```
