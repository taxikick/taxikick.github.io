title: AAA5106 - Mrt taft station, beside dunkin donuts. The place where taxis wait for passengers

### Name of taxi: It's not even a taxi I think. There's no sign or anything. I think it's a private car with a meter on

I know how much should be the cost of fare of a taxi from mrt taft to evanglista makati. I always ride taxis every week with the same route. Once the taxi took off, I immediately notice that the meter rides up with in seconds.   I immediately told the driver that 'kuya, ang bilis ata ng metro mo. Tama po ba yan?' He said that 'tama po yan, bawala po ang ano at mahuhuli tayo.' I shut up after that. I am alone and I am afraid of what will happen if I drag the conversation more. There is not even a bit of traffic since it is a sunday and is 1:30 pm. Usually, my fare will be 70 php. I was shocked when the meter reached 107 php. I don't wanna curse the driver. I believe he will eventually get what is right and fair. I don't want to ride his car anymore. Beware. I hope that he will be given a first offense. Not totally banning him from driving since that might be his only source of income but at least a sanction that will make him stop what he is doing. Other passengers are not as understanding as everyone else is. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
