### Name of taxi: Unknown

I rode the taxi in front of Kabayan Hotel near MRT station, and this taxi driver wants me to pay P120 to a restaurant in Macapagal Avenue because he doesn't have earnings yet since he started late. I declined paying P120 and he repriced it to P100 but I still declined it and told him that I'll just look for another taxi because he should be using the taxi meter, he agreed and dropped me off just in front of Metropoint Mall. I went back in front of Kabayan hotel and "luckily", I rode the same taxi again, this time he agreed to use the taxi meter. My bill was just P68 but I told him to just give me P20 so he'll have extra P12, but he insisted to just give me P10 then lent me the two five peso coin without me agreeing, then said "Magkikita tayo ulit te." I know we're not talking about a big amount of money, but that moment really scared me. I wanted to argue and ask for the exact change but I'm just alone and the driver is way bigger than me. He doesn't have his id displayed on his vehicle btw.
