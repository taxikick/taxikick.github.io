### Name of taxi: EFREN TOLENTINO ETC TAXI

Old Toyota Corolla, looks like 95 model. The meter keeps on flashing, got surprised that bill is already at 92php when we are at Calle Industria (my normal taxi fare from Imelda Ave to Eastwood is only 75-85php). The Meter suddenly went off and no fare is showing so Taxi Driver keeps on printing receipts and it already shows fare is at 155php. 

Taxi Driver claims that it is due to traffic, and we've been on the road for an hour already and a lot more lies. travel time is only 25 minutes. 

No ID on the dashboard to identify the driver. Got verbally assaulted as well saying that im "manloloko" ,"gago". too bad for him he gave me a receipt.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
