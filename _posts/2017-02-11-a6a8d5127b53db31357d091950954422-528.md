---

### Name of taxi: MGE

When we're on our way to cubao, he's driving fast as it made me dizzy and there are time when he does not give way for other cars and does always overtake on cars as if it was a race and he cuss people who's passing by but the door is close so im not sure how stress he was, when we are at our point of our destination. He is insisting that the flat rate is 40 pesos and i've insisted that it is 30 pesos only. The meter ranged at 138php so i've paid him 128php and he start cussing me and insisted that i have to pay 138php, so i did not know that the meter is running when we reach our destination so he oblig me to pay 140+ pesos and he said that i have to pay that amount . So i gave it and he started cussing then after i said my reason why it was like that and i have to report him and shouted at me while im preparing to get my bags and left.
