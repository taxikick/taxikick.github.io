### Name of taxi: Dimaculangan Taxi/Transportation

Earlier today, I hailed a taxi along Evangelista St., Makati City. I did not use my Grab app since he was already available. Mr. Padilla (as I have seen in his identification document, I can’t remember his first name) drove for a few meters when his smartphone indicated that there is a request for a ride (He is a Grab Taxi driver). He could’ve NOT accepted it but he did despite me riding shotgun!

Mr. Padilla asked me to alight his taxi and hail another ride. I told him that he shouldn’t have accepted the request. He replied that there is a consequence if he did not accept it. I am not privy to what sort of consequence this is.

Clearly, this is a violation of passenger rights. I have already ridden his taxi therefore he has the obligation to drive me to my destination and yet refused to because of a request from a Grab app user.
