title: UVG901 - From NAIA to Commonwealth
---

### Name of taxi: 

Hailed the cab in NAIA, he asked for +100. Because I was desperate to get home, I agreed to the additional 100. But halfway, he was complaining that 100 was not enough because my house was far. I live in Commonwealth in Quezon City. While it is far, I think 100 was enough but instead he was complaining about the traffic and how 100 is too low for his effort. He was very rude he also said "Mukhang may pera ka naman ano ba namang pagbigyan mo ko at magtulungan tayo."

```Contracting, No receipt```
