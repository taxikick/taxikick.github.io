### Name of taxi: LBR taxi

Its the second time this happened, i scheduled an LBR taxi at 9am. I was already at the lobby around 8:45am but i waited since i scheduled them at 9am. However I saw the taxi parked across the street, at the gas station. I didnt understand why he just parked there. Its the second time that this happened. I also contacted the operator informing her that I am already waiting outside. She said she will tell the driver. And she just hung up on me without even properly saying goodbye. Then she harrassed me with rude text messages. The taxi didnt come, it was past 9am already. The opertaor doesnt even know how to treat customers as well. It was obviously their fault. If the driver already knew that I was there he should have driven towards me already. The operator has even the audacity to tell me i am banned from LBR! Imagine? 

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
