### Name of taxi: Unknown 

We ride the taxi at the NAIA terminal 3 departure area. The taxi driver didn't open his meter and give us something like placard which the price and location indicated we want the driver to drop us at bicutan or tanyag but he charges us 850 for that ride. We start to complain and ask him we also asked him to drop us out but he refuses and speed up his driving until we reached our destination. Hope you can do something about this matter 

```Over charging, No meter```
