### Name of taxi:  

It was traffic at noontime. Imagine the afternoon heat and this! I observe hindi sya alert when we are about to move everytime. Even ung truck sa likod ko, nagagalit, honking just to let that taxi (in front of me ) to move! I keep my distance and hindi ko sya tinututukan fyi. When suddenly his taxi is going backwards and boom! Bangga na ang front plate ko! Demet manong driver, if you are sleepy, dont drive and go home, get some sleep!
