### Name of taxi: M. TIGAS AAX-5145

he refuses to turn the meter on and tell me that "how much would you give for that far?". then because its raining I have no other choice but to go in to the cab. then he turn the meter but after a few more talk he said "that the money that I will pay can help him". of course it will because its his job. But the one that I did not like is that his over charging me for Php500, but then we negotiate down to Php350 so I accept it. But I think its so over charge because from that distance I think I should give him only Php200 because the road has no traffic. sometimes when I call for a cab I accept plus 50 so that no more argument and from makati to our house I give the cab driver Php250 and I think thats a reasonable price because the meter is on. I the authorities should give this man a proper punishment so that he will not do this again to other commuters. this situation is one of the reason why some commuters might want to call UBER or Tranfortify or any other type of transportation because some of our cab drivers are abusing their passengers.
