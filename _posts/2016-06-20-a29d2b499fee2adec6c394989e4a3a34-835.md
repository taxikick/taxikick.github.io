### Name of taxi: Airport metered taxi

I took the yellow metered taxi at NAIA T2 with a friend, our destination being the JAC Liner bus terminal in Buendia. When we were close I asked the driver, Alex Bison according to his very large ID that obscured the meter, it was PHP 306. I was shocked because the last time I used an airport taxi three months ago, the bill didn't even reach PHP 150. The distance between the traveled was 7.3 km, with light traffic as it was past 6.30 am on a Saturday morning, and with the published rates (flag down, first 500m at PHP60, PHP4 for every succeeding 300m) I should be paying only half of that. We didn't make a scene, just paid up. I'm sure it's either the meter was running already even before we boarded or it was tampered with. We didn't see because the driver's huge ID was in the way. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
