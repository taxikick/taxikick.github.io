### Name of taxi: MOSTC

The Taxi driver initially honk his horn on me while i stopped on the stop light to go right from p.tuazon going to cubao. then right in front of araneta he cut through my lane and abruptly and intentionally stopped his taxi in front of my car and started cursing. He insisted that i should have turned right even though it is clearly is a red light.
