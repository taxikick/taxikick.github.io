### Name of taxi: Dollar Taxi

The meter charges so fast. I boarded the taxi past 9:00 AM but the receipt showed 8:49 AM. In less than an hour (including traffic), I was already in my destination. I got charged 176.50 when usually given the same traffic condition, I only get charged around 135-150. Based on the receipt distance I travelled was 7.6 KM

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
