### Name of taxi: Euro

Final fare amount is 68 pesos -- fare cost as per meter is 78 pesos minus 10 pesos rollback rate. We gave 70 pesos but driver insisted us to give him 80 pesos. We questioned him and even pointed out the rollback sticker inside his car but he said that it is not implemented anymore and he just forgot to remove it.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
