### Name of taxi: -

Despite the heavy rain,since the taxi is available we asked if he can take us to pasig, he answered wherein pasig? Then we mention the place, then he was like how much do you usually pay there?, and we were like we pay by the meter kuya. He answered, no! Its raining we cant accept it if it is metered. You need to have a contract amount so i can take you there. I answered that is against the law, him while shaking his head, i dont care im not going there then he walked away. The rudeness is astonishing. It shouldnt be like that. Kick that cab!

```Refused boarding, No meter```
