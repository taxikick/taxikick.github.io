### Name of taxi: QUADCORE

My amount due was P 185 and I remember the P 10 deduction so it should be P 175; but despite the amount, I gave the driver P180.

He wants me to pay the whole P185 but I said that "di ba po may minus 10?"

But he said "WALA NG MINUS 10 NAGYON..!"

I tried to find a five pesos but I have no coins.

I am giving him P 100; my smallest bill in my wallet but he refuses to take it and starts yelling "BUWISET..!" until I get out of the Taxi.

```Over charging, No receipt```
