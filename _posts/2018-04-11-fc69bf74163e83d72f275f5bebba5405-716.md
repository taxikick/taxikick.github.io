### Name of taxi: Unknown

When the driver found out our destination, he did not explicitly refuse the ride but kept on muttering/complaining throughout the trip. He kept on saying “Napalayo ako ha” “Masamang araw to” “Napasubo ako ha” and intentionally drove very slow and made disdain sounds. I don’t usually take cabs as there’s Uber before and this is one of the reasons why.

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
