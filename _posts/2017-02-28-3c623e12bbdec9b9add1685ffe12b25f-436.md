### Name of taxi: Unknown 

We are going to DFA and decided to take a cab. I thought the driver will use the meter but he didnt and asking us to pay 120 pesos and refuse to use the meter, he said its not easy to get a passenger going back. Which is such a lame excuse! So i told him to drop us off and then he started to yell at us and says things like "Ang kuripot mo, ilocana ka!" (Which we're not btw!) What a very rude behavior! LTFRB should give this  taxi driver a big lesson! The reason why taxi has a meter is for it to be use and not to take it for granted. 

```Over charging, No meter```
