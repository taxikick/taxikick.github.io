### Name of taxi: Mge

I requested the driver to lower the volume of his radio because I got a phone call and he said "nakikinig ako sa balita eh" 

I answered my call and was having difficulty bec of the volume. After my call I questioned him "Bakit ayaw mo ibawas ung radio nung nakikita mo ginagamit ko ung cellphone?" He then started shouting and saying "ano akala mo sa akin? Basta driver ako ay dapat makinig ako sayo? Maghanap ka ng ibang taxi" 

I repeatedly told him not to lie because I just requested and he dropped me in the middle of the road. I even reported it to the ayala security around who saw the exchange of words and he asked me to report it to the police station.
