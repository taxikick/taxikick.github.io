### Name of taxi: I forgot

It was Sto Nino festival so expecting traffic. Taxi driver kept complaining for the entire 1 and a half hours. During payment he didnt give me correct change saying he got stuck in taxi. My bill is 330. I gave 400 and first he said he wont give change then i ask him but said he will only give 40. Opportunistic and negative behavior. Im tired from work and the last thing i want to hear is whining and complaining from taxi driver.  

```Rude behavior```
