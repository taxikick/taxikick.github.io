### Name of taxi: Forgot the name

My mother and I boarded this taxi and upon boarding he said of a "Packaged Deal" on a claimed traffic on a Sunday morning about 10:15AM and he will be charging PHP 300.00. After we reached our destination he suddenly raised his charge to PHP 400.00. He never used his meter during the trip.

```Over charging, No meter```
