### Name of taxi: Cruzette Taxi

This afternoon (08-10-16 around 11:28am), my niece and I rode a Cruzette Taxi with a plate number TYR -114 near Paco PNR station. We asked the driver to take us to SM Manila. The driver took another route intead of taking Quirino Ave. Ext. He said there was a traffic at UN Ave. and he'll just take the route to Ayala Bridge. Instead, he pass the route going to Ayala Bridge. We insisted to drop us by Mendiola (beside CEU Manila). He got mad at us when we got off and asked for the receipt (we got off his taxi by 11:45 pm). I was about to ask his name because he was being rude and no name tag or I.D was hung inside the said taxi, when he told us to close the door of the taxi in an angry tone. I hope that this matter would be taken care of. Thank you and God Bless.
