### Name of taxi: Airport Yellow Taxi

On my way home from NAIA Terminal 1, 26 Dec 2016. Around 9.40PM. The security in the airport directed me to use yellow meter taxi then, I got this yellow meter airport taxi from the waiting line :

1. The meter suddenly show random number, not working properly, *after driver did some tapping on it.

2. When pass the new skyway, driver was lying about using his card so there is an extra charge P45.

3. When reach destination driver was insisted to use other number in meter which is very expensive. P410.(with no traffic from NAIA T1 Airport).

4. Driver had tendency not to give the changes.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
