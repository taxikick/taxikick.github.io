### Name of taxi: BYN Trans

Driver chooses passengers and yet does not want to get out of the line so that next driver may be able to take us, very rude that he insulted us by saying that it was our fault not getting a ride because we were still out at sm at around 8:00pm blaming us that we shouldn't be there when in fact we had 3 heavy grocery bags to carry that's why we need a taxi, this rude driver does not want us to get a cab for no reason, he's been shouting and cursing like crazy.

```Choosing passengers, Rude behavior```
