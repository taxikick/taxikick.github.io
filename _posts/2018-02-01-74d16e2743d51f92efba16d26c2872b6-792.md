title: UVW159 - Cubao to BGC
---

### Name of taxi: Saint Sebastian

Hailed a Taxi from Araneta Center, Cubao going to BGC with the usual traffic and stress commuting to work. By the time i reached Lanuza ave. going to C-5 i noticed the taxi meter reading was already 243php and my usual taxi ride on a normal day from Cubao to BGC is around 180 to 220php. i was suddenly alarmed by this and asked the driver if the meter reading was correct. upon reaching my destination gave the driver a 500 peso bill seeing the meter was around 330+ and he confidently gave my change of 150php. paid for almost two of my normal rides and still gave himself a "TIP". Felt like crying and ruined my day!

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
