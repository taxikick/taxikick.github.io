### Name of taxi: Ceba Trans

We are in a hurry to go to Lakefront. He asked us how much we were willing to pay. We asked him back if isn't there a meter. He said he doesn't use meters for the reason that "pila po kasi ako dito eh". I checked via grab and the fare was only 227 Php. He was asking us for 300 php. We asked if he could make it 250 Php, he said it woild be unfair for him going back. We thought that all there is but he also said that we are the ones who would also pay the toll fee of 34php. Like, what, isn't that already too much?! I hope we could eradicate such taxi drivers who are a disgrace in the society!

```Over charging, No meter```
