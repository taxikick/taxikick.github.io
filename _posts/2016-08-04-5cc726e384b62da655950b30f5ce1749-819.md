### Name of taxi: I was not able to get it 

On August 2,2016 around 2:30 pm, I grab this taxi at PBCOM Shaw . The taxi driver was first hesitant to drive me in the said area. The rude taxi drive dropped me along Kalayaan Highway  wherein the agreement is to drop me at TELUS Mckinley along Makati. I noticed that the meter starts at P47.00 which I did not pay much attention. I believe that this man foreseen the traffic along Ayala Bridge which caused him to pretend as if he is talking someone over the phone which I heard " Malapit na Mam",  he told me".  The main motive why I act talking to someone else is not to be caught in the traffic. He abandoned me and told me that he will have to go to his client in Market 2X . He told me "Ibababa ko n po kayo dito pwede kayo sumakay jan, mga bakante yan" I told him " Kuya wala namang usapan n ibaba niyo ko dito"
