title: TXL710 - Escoda Street, Sta Mesa Manila

### Name of taxi: GERLIN

My daughter and I boarded his taxi in SM Centerpoint in Sta.Mesa Manila to Escoda Street also in Sta Mesa Manila. His flag down rate shows 40.00 when it should be 30.00. When we reach our destination, his meter reached 54.00 to be exact. I gave him only 50.00 as the total rate is less 10.00 because of the flag down rate of 30.00. He asked why only 50.00 and not 54.00. I explained to him that the flag down rate for taxi is supposed to be 30.00 but he shouted at me and said there is no flag down rate of 30.00. I tried explaining it again but he kept on saying "bayaran mo ko ng tama". I ignored him but he continue shouting saying "sa halagang 4.00 pesos tinatakbuhan nyo ako!" and even thrown profanity words against us. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated.  

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
