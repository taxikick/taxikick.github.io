### Name of taxi: SENTEUR

I hailed him. He rolled down the passenger side window and asked for my destination. When I answered Marikina, he refused. When I took pictures and told him I could report him to LTFRB - he shouted, "Wala ako pakialam. Hindi ako natatakot sa LTFRB. Magkita tayo doon."

```Refused boarding```
