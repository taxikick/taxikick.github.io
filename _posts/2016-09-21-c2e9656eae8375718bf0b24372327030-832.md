### Name of taxi: Unknown

Fare from Edsa Pasay cor. Edang Street to McKinley Hill was P138.00 (less the P10) so total fare should only be P128.00. I gave the driver P150.00. I was waiting for my change so I did not get out of the taxi yet. Driver had no intention to give a change as he was already ready to drive away but I was still inside so he stared at me (as if asking why I was still there). So I told him that he has not given me my change yet. I also said that his meter was probably broken (as my usual fare never exceeds P130 even with the usual traffic). Then he gave me P2.00 and said "Huwag ka nang sumakay ng taxi kung gusto mong magtipid."

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
