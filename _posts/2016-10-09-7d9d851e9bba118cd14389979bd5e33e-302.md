---

### Name of taxi: AL SUHAIDEN

We rode on this taxi with my kids from centrio to macasandig. He wasnt able to turn on the meter and reminded him aroun few meters away from the mall. He then told me that he forgot but he estimated it as 75 pesos. When we arrived to our destination, the meter is only 54. He insisted that i should pay 174. I told him that the usual rate is only 75 buy he already shouting and insisting. I gave what he asked and moved out from the taxi since my kids are already afraid of him.

```Over charging, No meter```
