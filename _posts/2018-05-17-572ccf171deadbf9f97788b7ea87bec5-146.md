### Name of taxi: R VILLEGAS

I was  too shocked to notice that his meter pins up 3x the normal range. I always get a cab going to work, and this is first to get a super high fare from my usual. I observed his meter and it rises/pins up 3x from the normal one.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
