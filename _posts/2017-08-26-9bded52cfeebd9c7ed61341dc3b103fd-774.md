### Name of taxi: mvbs

traffic sa katipunan the driver opted to take a different route so ok tapos nung nasa Marcos Highway na kami sobrang traffic eh may alternative route papuntang pasig,  Naka waze rin kami, he blindly didn't take the desired route of waze but instead moved forward eh clearly sobrang traffic,  when I complained he said that he didn't know that route and pinaikot ikot nya ako, dapat sana nag grab nalang ako mas mahal pa fare ko sa taxi kaysa sa grab tindi
