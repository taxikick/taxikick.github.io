### Name of taxi: Rmcc

I took a regular taxi lane from airport. When my taxi arrived I told him just makati cityland buendia, he started driving, but just a few meters away he is asking for 250php because it is traffic inside makati. I ask if we ca use the meter but he refuses, I joke him that you go back to airport using skyway again after you drop me. He replied "wala ako kasama bumalik at yung toll". Then I told him i'll pay his toll another additional 25php for the skyway going back to airport, then he replied "200php sir kung ayaw mo bumaba ka nalang". Then I have no choice but to pay him 200php + skyway toll than ditch me in the middle of the street. Hoping for your response,  anyway he doesn't have ID inside the car so I couldn't get his name. Thanks!

```Over charging, No meter```
