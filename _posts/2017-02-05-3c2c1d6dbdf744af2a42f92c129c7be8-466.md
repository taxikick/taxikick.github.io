### Name of taxi: PRINCESS BARBIE

We were 5 passengers as there is a jeepney strike today and there is no other choice of transportation. We were asked to pay 80 each. 1 person has a 500 peso billcon which the driver has no change. The driver stopped to a gas station in navotas, 5 km from where he picked us up. He then asked the person to have his bill changed. Once the person alighted the car, the driver sped off and left the person stranded.
