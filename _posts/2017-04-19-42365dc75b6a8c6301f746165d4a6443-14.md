### Name of taxi: Princessken Taxi

around 940PM last night, we boarded from karangalan, pasig going to partas terminal in cubao. there were 4 of us. my mom, my nephew, my niece (4-year old) and myself. we were already in eastwood when the driver mentioned of 70 pesos in addition to the meter reading. when we got to edsa, he turned right going to e. rodriguez. i immediately corrected him so he had to trail back a few meters and took aurora, instead. that's when i noticed that he was drunk. we ended up paying 310 pesos, much more than the usual rate (220-230 pesos). 

```Over charging, Contracting```
