### Name of taxi: El Pueblo Transport Service

I wanted a ride to Terminal 4. Driver said 500 pesos. I said use the meter and I will give you a tip. He then said 300 pesos. I told him he had to use the meter as that was the law. He drove away and I took pictures of the car. This happened at approximarely 10:30 AM.
