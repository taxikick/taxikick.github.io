### Name of taxi: Unknown

I arrived at victory liner pasay. Around 10 pm. I took the taxi and said my location. The driver didnt open the meter and told me that i need to pay 300 pesos which is usually 100 pesos ride from victory to merville. I was very disappointed coz i didnt have big money with me. But i was force to agree.

```Over charging, No meter```
