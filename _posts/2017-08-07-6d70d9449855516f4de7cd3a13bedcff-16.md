### Name of taxi: Unknown

At around 12noon of Aug.6,2017 at NIA terminal 3 when I was a about to look for a taxi going to NIA terminal 1 when a taxi driver approach me and I say yes with the condition that it should be in meter in a regular flag down rate kaya pumayag ako.I was so shocked when he said I owe him 5oo pesos I had to argue with him pero sabi niya yun daw ang regular na binabyaran dun at isa  pa noong dumaan kmi sa skyway ako pa ang pinabyad nya sa toll gate.
