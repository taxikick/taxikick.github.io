title: TXR793 - Going from Megamall to Makati Cinema Square. I drop off at Chino Roces Ave. near mcdo gil puyat
---

### Name of taxi: A.A.GALANG TRANS.

I rode from Megamall & asked the driver to take me to Makati (Cinema) Square.
It was fine at first but after awhile the meter started making noise every min and the meter price went up. 
I started staring the meter and driver kept on raising his arms trying to cover the meter but I kept on checking the price and later on the sound stopped...
if that meter sound was really supposed to be, why the sound from the meter weren't there for the whole time?

Also he kept on taking the wrong way or longer way to MCS, so I asked 
"Excuse me, but you don't know the venue? Makati Cinema Square, po Pasong Tamo" 
and he said "ah, rockwell, still far(or something in tagalog)" so I felt scared and said to just drop me near the Makati Central Post Office.
But he was still trying to move so I shouted "I will get off here!!" & I payed exact 145pesos from the meter.
Thank god I was able to get off. I was across the street to mcdo Gil Puyat so I just walked straight going to MCS.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
