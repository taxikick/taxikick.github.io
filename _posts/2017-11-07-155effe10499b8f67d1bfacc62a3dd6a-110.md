title: WQT-901 - paramount along sm north edsa
---

### Name of taxi: unchecked

I took the taxi upon boarding from a bus. i told him where to go, vasra, quezon city almost along visayas avenue. Then he drove along edsa until we reached intersection, he turned left to north avenue going to quezon memorial circle then entered visayas avenue. I complained after he turned to north avenue why didn't he just u-turn when we're in edsa so we could just take edsa north and turn to mindanao avenue and take road 1 instead. The meter amounted to 106.50 when we reached our destination. This taxi driver is abusing his passenger by taking the long route instead of the shorter one resulting to high amount fare.
