title: UVG794 - C5 Road near McKinley

### Name of taxi: Unknown

He dropped me right in the middle of C5 road (Somewhere between McKinley and Pinagsama Village) where there is no establishment in 1:30am. He asked me to point the direction. I already said that the way is under the bridge but he said that he did not hear it. He dropped me over the bridge. He got easily annoyed and he shouted at me that I should get off his taxi.
