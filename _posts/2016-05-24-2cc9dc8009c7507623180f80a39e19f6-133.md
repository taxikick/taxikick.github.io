title: UVB382 - UN, Taft along Manila Medical Center going to Pandacan Manila
---

### Name of taxi: 

The taxi we rode on didn't have any meters for the fare. We were asking him politely but we got no response until we reached our destination. UN, Taft is quite near to pandacan so he insisted that we pay PhP 100 for the whole trip. I told him it was just nearby and we didn't encounter any traffic at all. He just said he knows exactly the fare because he always make the trip within the vicinity.

```Over charging, No meter```
