### Name of taxi: Worldwide Taxi

Hailed the taxi around 1:35. While onboard, driver was evidently falling asleep. I felt extremely unsafe and scared at the same time. Driver's eyes were very red and droopy and there were episodes where in we almost stopped in the middle of the road because he was snoozing. I was tok scared to react and voice-out. Telling him to pull-over was very challenging as my entire body sa trembling in fear. When we reached our destination, I confronted him and paid the due amount. Driver hurriedly drove away but I captured important info like plate # and the car.
