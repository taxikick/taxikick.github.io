### Name of taxi: Unknown

It was 7:30 in the evening when me and my wife are about to go home from my brother's house. Before we board the taxi, the driver asked if where will be our destination. I answered "Hipodromo". Then the driver refused us to board and suddenly ran away. I cannot estimate the distance between Soong Lapu-lapu City and Hipodromo Cebu City but the fare is around Php250. Perhaps, the driver is choosing passenger within Lapu-lapu City destination only.
