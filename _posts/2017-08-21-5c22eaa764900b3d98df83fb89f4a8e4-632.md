### Name of taxi: Unknown

We were looking for a metered taxi when we arrive Manila, then one taxi driver approached us to ride with him since he has metered taxi, then I agreed since I actually looking for that and had a limted budget. When we were on our way, I just realize that he did not click the button in meter because I was just tired. And when we reached home, And then he clicked the meter, what surprised us is the price which is 649pesos. Actually he ask us for tollgate (35pesos) so we will not stuck in the traffic, realizing that it's just 7AM. Then I immediately argue with him about the price because I'm always travelling and know how much should it cost from NAIA 3 to mandaluyong and I'm just paying less than 200pesos. I was really upset arguing with him and he said that  it not a problem giving him 200pesos and it's up to us. But to think that if that meter did not have defect he will defend himself and the price. So meaning his just fooling us, maybe thinking that were just new in Manila. 

```Tampered or broken meter```
