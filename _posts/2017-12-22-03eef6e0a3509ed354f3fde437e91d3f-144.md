### Name of taxi: -

The time we ride the taxi, I noticed that his meter is still off. Then he asked us to add 100 if we want to use the meter. He was so upset that he wouldnâ€™t have us agree. We have several groceries since we have a charity event. The rude and arrogant driver just then drove us few meters away but we still paid his flag down. He was just there watching us as we alight from the car.
