### Name of taxi: 

Driver told us to give change to a young kid who was meddling with the grocery we brought in. We refused, he insisted. And shouted, 'Bigyan nyo!'. 'Kung 'di kayo magbibigay, ako na lang ang magbibigay!', he added.

At this point, he has not started driving yet even if we were already settled in the car. He had to be told to start driving.

He drove fastly, and was even counterflowing. 

Upon arrival at the destination, the meter read P71. We gave him P100 but he never gave us any change.



```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
