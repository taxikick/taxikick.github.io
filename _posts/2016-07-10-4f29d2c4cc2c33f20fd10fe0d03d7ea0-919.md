### Name of taxi: 

Had just arrived in pier3 in cebu and lined up in the taxi lane with 3 kids and an infant, and 3 full backpacks and a shoulder bag for baby essentials. Hailed a cab for sm where we were supposedly meeting my aunt. Taxi driver was hesitant to take us upon learning destination... I asked, why "is this lane not for metered taxis?" which he said metered... He was forced to take us in when the guard signalled him to get moving as there were other passengers waiting to get a cab and taxis waiting to get passengers. He drove wrecklessly. Which i then mindfully memorized his plate number. When we got to the corner of the block of sm.. He hurried us off the cab. "Dri ra mo naog". I asked him to drop us off properly at the mall entrance considering i had 3 kids, an infant plus luggage. He said i didn't make that deal with him at the terminal.. Should i have? Do specifically need to specify to a driver to drop me off properly at a taxi unloading area upon hailing? I madly let my kids off and my child realized he had left the bag of baby essentials. The driver sped off.. My child cried loudly as to how rude we were left off the street. A guard came to inquire what happened.. He ran after the driver who parked at the sm taxi lane (where he could have dropped us off properly). The guard was able to retrieve the bag and advised i file a compliant as he saw the driver himself was arrogant.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
