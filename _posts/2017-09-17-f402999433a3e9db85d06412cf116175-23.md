### Name of taxi: Unknown

Driver didn't follow the directions given with regards to location of the drop off point. 
The driver then got agitated, when my girlfriend requested to be dropped off to the original pickup location, his temper got really worse. My girlfriend asked to be dropped off immediately, fearing that the driver might do something even dangerous. The taxi driver then grabbed my girlfriend's arm and threatened to crash the taxi.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
