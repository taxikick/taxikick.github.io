title: TXM251 - Resorts World Manila to Tenement Taguig
---

### Name of taxi: AFU Taxi

I got down in Resorts World from my bus(from Baguio) and hailed the first taxi bec Im rushing to go home since I have to be on time for my shift in less than 2hrs. When I got in and thru the trip, I got into a bargain with the driver who asked me how much I'd pay for the trip. I told him to ise the meter and he kept on the bargain starting at 300. I said no, use the meter, then he went 200 to 180 to 170. I said 150 or use the meter. He kept mumbling how he was lugi bec of the traffic and how far it was (which really isn't) and that he won't be getting any passengers in the way back( like it's my problem). He kept complaining and asking me that even though this traffic I'd only give 150. I said yes, even cheaper. He has no aircon btw and has the front windows down. Typed this otw, will send this when we get there. 

```No meter, Contracting```
