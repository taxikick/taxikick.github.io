### Name of taxi: Grab taxi

The driver was asking us to pay double the fare to take us to our destination. The driver stated that it is out of his way and I have to pay him as well to get back in the city. I told the driver I won't pay him more than what grab taxi stated I should be paying him. The driver refused to take us to our destination unless we pay him what he asked for. It was very inconvenient since we were already loaded in the cab with all our luggage along with a senior citizen and a baby.
