### Name of taxi: Don't see the taxi name

I took a taxi given by the valet man of megamall taxi queue. He did not make a meter and when I said I only paid 60 during traffic hours and it's already 11pm. He did not give me back my change and insist that inside the ortigas it's always 100 pesos

```Over charging, No meter```
