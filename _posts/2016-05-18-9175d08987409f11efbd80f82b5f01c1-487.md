title: A0A956 - He fetch us in St. James Mindanao Avenue going to Jam transit in Kamias
---

### Name of taxi: 

When we ride that taxi in St. JAMES he was asking for 250 pesos, since im working in Heart center, im familiar how much is the fare going toKamias. I said I just give him additional 30 plus the meter. As we travelling, ive noticed that he didnt plug down the meter

```Over charging, No meter```
