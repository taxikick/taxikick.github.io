### Name of taxi: Jesmiel Taxi

Usually my fare from Makati Mandaluyong bridge going to Quirino Avenue usually costs 90 to 120 pesos at the same time on a similar day, this time it costed me 170 pesos, the taxi driver was talking to me so as to disturb me from looking at the meter, meter was tampered, with a device attatched to it. Taxi driver was overspeeding and was not following suggestions where we should pass. His ID was hidden. 

```Tampered or broken meter, No receipt```
