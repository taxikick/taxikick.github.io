### Name of taxi: WENZILY

We were travelling to Terminal 3 from red planet mabini, the driver did not turn the meter on, we just noticed while on the skyway already because we were in a hurry, when we got to the airport, he charged us 700php for the trip. This was at 5am with no traffic. 

```Over charging, No meter```
