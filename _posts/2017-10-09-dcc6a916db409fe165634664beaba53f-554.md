### Name of taxi: Jerce

It was raining hard here in Baguio and I took a cab going to Metrobank Magsaysay branch, then this taxi driver said it was traffic and he doesn’t want to go there and drop me off. He even decided to go with the longer route (Upper Bonifacio road to SLU). He then said that I should take the jeepney instead and he will drop me off at SLU Bonifacio. I didn’t reach my main destination!

```Rude behavior```
