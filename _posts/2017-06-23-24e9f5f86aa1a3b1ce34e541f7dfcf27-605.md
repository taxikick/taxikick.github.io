### Name of taxi: Worldwide I think

When we got in the driver was stoppin at all times even when it's a go signal. I asked him to please refer me as a sir not a mam(I'm a guy). He still wouldn't call me sir. When we went off he told us that he hadn't take shabu or crystal meth YET please check him. P.S. He slowed down our address to watch where we lived please help

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
