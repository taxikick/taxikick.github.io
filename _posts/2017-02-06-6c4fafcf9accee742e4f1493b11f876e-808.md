### Name of taxi: was not able to take note

I informed the driver the Location to go. He replied, "How much?". I answered by your meter. He replied via nodding "No". He move away. He doesnt not want to go by the standard and lawfull metered ride. He wants to contract the ride. I had to wait for another taxi.
