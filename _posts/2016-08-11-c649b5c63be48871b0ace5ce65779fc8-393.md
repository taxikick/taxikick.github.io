title: APA9184 - Manila, Philippines. NAIA Terminal 2 going to POEA Ortigas, Makati.
---

### Name of taxi: Wasn't able to get the name of the taxi because the driver went out hurriedly.

We were from NAIA Terminal 2 when we looked for a taxi. A lot of drivers refused us but only this driver was convinced to serve us. We should went to POEA Ortigas as our stop. We do have the good chats with the driver about anything: where we have been, what's the purpose we're here, etc. Later on, he said that our taxi is already running on 9 kilometers which has already have worh P1860.00 of fare. Shocked about the price, we decided to dropped off where that guy told us then paid that price.... clearly, as "promdi" because we came from Davao and don't know how tricky these taxi drivers in Manila, we got no choice but to pay that price. We also wasn't able to get his identification because he didn't post his ID on the backseat. He also didn't have a taxi meter. I hope this incident will be acknowledged so that driver won't have another victim like us.

```Over charging, No meter```
