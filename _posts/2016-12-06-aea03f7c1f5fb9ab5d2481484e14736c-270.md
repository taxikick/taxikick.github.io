### Name of taxi: M.G.E

I ask him if it is wrong way, he answered no ma'am we go this way.So I keep my self calm because I know its a correct way.In Zobel street,he started asking  that ma'am is it ok for you to pay 2000 because my meter is an airport meter.That was very questionable,2000 pesos?From Dian Makati City to Magallanes Makati worth 2000 pesos because he said it is airport taxi. He stop the taxi and he said your meter 250 pesos,from dian to zobel.A big amount of money, Because I don't have change i ask him if he has a change of 1000,he answered me yes.Then i give my money and suddenly said another 100, then i was so confused,i said,manong i give 1000 pesos.He said it's 100,he showed the 100 pesos.I keep on repeating that I give 1000. I was so nervous that time I give 100 and he said maam go out of taxi. Then after going out of taxi I was thinking I gave him greater amount of money.
