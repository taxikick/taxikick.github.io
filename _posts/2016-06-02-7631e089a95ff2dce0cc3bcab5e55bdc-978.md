title: MWB570 - General Santos City
---

### Name of taxi: NA

Pick up point at Dolyn's Suites, Labangal (fronting Pacman Convenience Store). I asked the manager and the reeptionists the exact fare of the taxi, and they all told me it's 350PHP.

Dropped off at General Santos Airport, the driver took the amount 400PHP. The driver did not give the change needed and went straight out the airport.

If you happen to be in GenSan, make sure to take a good look at the taxi's plate number and make sure it's not MWB570. I still do not have the name of the driver, but I will find all means to find the driver's name and have it reported any time soon.
