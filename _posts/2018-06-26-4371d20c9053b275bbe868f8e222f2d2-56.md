### Name of taxi: N/A

I ride from SM Megamall to Magallanes around 5:40am. I always ride taxi and fare usually is less than P120(with normal traffic) then I noticed that the taxi meter was changing so fast and it ended up to 145 pesos without traffic. Was expecting fare to be the same or less since there was literally no traffic like holiday. When I saw that my meter was on the 100sh i started looking at the meter and boy its not normal

```Tampered or broken meter```
