### Name of taxi: Did not get it

My wife on board this Taxi in SM Cebu going to Tisa, Cebu City. The driver refuses to go in the road going to our house. The problem is they have groceries and other stuffs. Instead of tell my wife that his not a good driver and cannot maneuver the way, he then curse them about the place. Like his talking to his to uneducated personal. I really cant express how crazy he is. Super arrogant with foul mouth.

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
