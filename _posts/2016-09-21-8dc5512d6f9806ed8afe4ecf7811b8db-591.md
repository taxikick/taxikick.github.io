### Name of taxi: Unknown

Driver overcharged me. I was from NAIA going to France embassy and he kept asking question and demanded thatbi don't use cellphone as his taxi is LPG powered and it would cause explosion. I asked him to stop the car and drop me off after the skyway. He stopped at a petron station just about around buendia and demanded I pay 1500. when i refused, he locked the car and drove fast. he shouted at me when I kepknocking at the windowsothe people outside would  see me. I was already panicking so i told him i would pay him f he would just stop the car. He stopped at another petron station and took my 1500 pesos without any receipt.

```Over charging, No receipt```
