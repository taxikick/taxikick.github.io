### Name of taxi: Murry is the family name written inside the taxi.

The driver keeps on asking if our destination won’t reach cypress. Then i observed that the meter keeps on going high. Wala pang one minute, tumaas na naman ang metro. Our usual taxi fare is 77 without traffic but this time, it was 95 and it’’s not even traffic-3:00 am. We just gave him 100 because we want to get out from the taxi immediately.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
