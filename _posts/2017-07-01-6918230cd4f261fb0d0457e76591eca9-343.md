title: UVU443 - Terminal 4 to Villamor Airbase
---

### Name of taxi: EDMICHELYN

Plate #: UVU 443
Name: EDMICHELYN 
Date: July 2,2017
Time: 0128H 
Place:Terminal 4(Domestic Terminal) to Villamor Airbase 

The taxi driver didn't turn on the meter and instead told me that its only 100 php from Terminal 4 to Villamor Airbase. I acted like i didn't actually heard what he said and put on my headset. During the ride i notice him adjusting the mirror at the front and he keeps on looking at me thru the mirror and at that time i pretended to check my phone or texting someone. The way he looks at me is really scary because it looks like he's planning something bad or dangerous that's why when i already saw the 7/11 store near villamor i ask him to stop the taxi and before i pay him i open first the door and gave him 70php for the ride.  During the ride i also notice the back shield or back window is Also covered with cards or used boxes. 

I hope that you can check or profile the driver. Please do something about this kind of incident. Thank you.
