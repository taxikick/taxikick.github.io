---

### Name of taxi: El Castle

My wife ride a taxi from NAIA to Makati. Driver is too talkative regarding passengers that don't pay properly. Some of them are being holdup and rape. Afterwards, the driver said that the taxi fare will cost Php 550. Because he is not a metered taxi and not included to those taxi who fall in line. My wife said she doesn't have Php 550. The driver said that she should not say those things because those who said that they have no money are the one most likely to be holdup. My wife worried about what the driver said and ask if she can be drop-off now because she don't have Php 550. The driver bargain to pay only Php 350 instead of Php 550. Then the driver also telling her that she have a celebrity look a like thats why my wife gets more afraid. After they reach there destination. The driver cannot provide receipt and gave my wife a piece of paper referring her taxi fare.

```Over charging, No meter```
