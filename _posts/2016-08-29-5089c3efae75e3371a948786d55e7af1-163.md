title: AAA5911 - NAIA Terminal 3 to MOA
---

### Name of taxi: ONASSIS

Overcharging, just from Naia T3 going to Mall of Asia, I was charged of P1,200.00. He said that its airport rate but I'm really shocked that it costs me that much for about 5,000meters.. Also, He won't let me use my cellphone even in texting telling me that he uses LPG that's why its dangerous. He gets mad whenever my friend calls me. I'm not familiar with the airport taxi's rate but I think there's something wrong with what I experienced.

```Over charging, No receipt```
