title: UVP242 - Market Market to SM Sucat

### Name of taxi: NJ

Boarded at Market Market and when I told him the destination he said,  "Ma'am,  bahala ka na dagdag mo mamaya ha. " He said that while tje cab was already at C5 and it would be hard for me to get a different ride. I did not respond. We were only at West Service Road when I noticed the fare was already P230. I ride a cabe evryday,  on the same route and the fare is usually between P200-220,  with traffic. It's  a Saturday,  no traffic on that way and we were only halfway. Sobrang overcharging. Reckless driver pa. While we were at C5 he was zipping in and out of traffic. Parang ahas. Twice muntik mabangga kung hindi malakas yung brakes nya. This is why I usually take Uber at bihira na magtaxi. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
