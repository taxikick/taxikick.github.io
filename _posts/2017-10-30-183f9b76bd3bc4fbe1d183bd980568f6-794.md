### Name of taxi: E.O.L. Trans

Taxi with operator number 09178033788 and with taxi name E.O.L. Trans did the "spray" modus operandi yesterday, 5:30am at Karuhatan Valenzuela City. I was the only passenger during that time. As I was just entering, the driver said "Ma'am isasara ko lang yung bintana, yung unang pasahero ko kasi ayaw ng aircon eh." I suddenly smelled a pungent and awful smell. I started to feel the heaviness in my body, I found it hard to breathe and  move my hands and feet, though I could still think properly. I opened the car window to release the smell but still I felt the diffuculty in breathing. I told him to stop the car along Balintawak. I paid him 120 pesos for the Fare.  He said, "sayang naman, malapit na". I wasn't able to get the plate number since I was in a hurry during that time. Also, I realized that the driver's ID in front did not mention the name of the driver, only the name of the taxi and some explanation of the taxi's name.
