### Name of taxi: Excellence Trans

We ride at Trinoma Mall parking. When I opened the door, I told the driver we are going to San Mateo. He asked how much I will give him. I refuse to ride because I told I will only ride on metered taxi. But he called us and said that he is okay with that. When we are on our way, the driver complaining about the traffic going to the place. I told him that theres going to have traffic in all places right now because of the season. He said no because its already new year (meaning its only on our place theres traffic) When we are already near the place, he complaint even more, saying that its only metered and yet we are asking him to go exactly our place where the street is not that wide anymore like the national road. Please do something about this kind of driver. If they dont want to give rides to people then they shouldnt be a driver at all. Its really frustrating to have these kind of people in the street.
