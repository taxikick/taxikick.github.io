title: AAM5240 - Medical City Ortigas to Chino Roces Makati
---

### Name of taxi: DONCYL

I rode a taxi just earlier tonight, with the details mentioned above. Typically when I ride taxis from Medical City Ortigas to my house in Makati, going thru EDSA, it will cost me around 130 to 160 pesos only, even with the usual EDSA traffic. When I was near my destination, around Ayala, I noticed that the meter is covered by a cloth / pamunas. The driver noticed that I was looking at the covered meter, then he removed the cloth and started to turn on and off the Aircon, pretending to check if the Aircon is working fine. I was surprised to see that the meter is already at 170 pesos, but EDSA was not even that traffic going southbound tonight. So I immediately knew that during the trip, he must have a fast meter. I also noticed that my trip was 12km long, typically it won't even take 11km. 

```Tampered or broken meter```
