title: UVW948 - Roxas blvd going to heritage pasay city
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Not sure if i went to the correct place to voice out my anger to this very rude and disrepectful taxi driver. We were riding a motorcycle along roxas blvd going to Heritage Pasay. We were in the correct lane when this rude taxi driver (plate number UVW 948) suddenly cut out lane. I think he was also overspeeding. This taxi driver also loves to overtake. We almost met an accident due to him. I even saw him staring and intimidating us.These kind of people should not be given driver's license due to their reckless behaviour. More road accidents will happen because if this kind of attitude.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
