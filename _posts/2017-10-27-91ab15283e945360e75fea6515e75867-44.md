### Name of taxi: Cant recall

We immediately boarded the taxi with my 2 babies, my mom who is a senior and dad , and when we told the driver where we are heading(cainta), he suddenly refused because of the heavy traffic daw, that we have to add more than 100 pesos which we refused also, then finally told us that gagarahe na raw sya but it was still 3pm!
