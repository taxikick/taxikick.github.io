### Name of taxi: Uno Taxi

The driver chose another passenger. We are the ones who came in the line first but a rude lady interrupted our conversation. The lady forcibly entered the taxi cab and the driver never reacted or at least tell her to go down. Instead, he closed the windows, never said any word and drove away. It's so disrespectful to turn us down just because someone entered the cab even if it's our turn in the first place.
