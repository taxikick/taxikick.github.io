### Name of taxi: MGE

So theres a 1st passenger the driver refused to board (dont know the reason), so he stopped on me and i entered and asked my destination. My destination is just from BGC burgos circle to Uptown Mall and asking for additional 30 pesos. I asked why and he said its traffic and i found the way he talks to me very rude. So i answered, "no kuya, ang lapit lang kasi". And he keeps on talking and i went down and i said "okay lang kuya". Then another passenger approached him and he still refused it. 

While i am waiting for my booked uber after that, 2 taxi drivers refused the passengers in my side. I wonder why??
