title: NP1056 - Congressional Ave, Quezon City 
---

### Name of taxi: Mitsubishi Mirage (Silver)

Someone I know booked a grabcar in congressional ave in Quezon City. The person noticed that the driver was taking too long so the person decided to give this driver a call, but then the call was answered by an enraged voice claiming that he was waiting there exchanging cuss and foul mouth words with the security guards because they won't let him in and claiming that the passenger didn't show up but in fact the passenger didn't even see the grabcar NP1056 even pas by and the driver was screaming in his phone then cancelled the passenger after the call. That made the person call for an Uber instead. Such rude behavior shouldn't be tolerated and rude liars like that shouldn't even be allowed to pick up passengers just trying to go to their destination much leads have a driver's license. An example of someone who doesn't know how to respect. Who's a piece of crap. The likes of these people shouldn't even be allowed to drive, absolutely bad for business.
