title: VDT450 - Gil Puyat Ave., Makati

### Name of taxi: ADLER TAXI

We got on Gamboa St. and told hin we were going to A. Venue Mall in Makati Ave. He turned right to Rada and said that he would pass through Paseo de Roxas instead. We thought he was going to go straight to Makati Ave. but to our surprise, he made a left turn to Ayala Ave. So now we thought, he was trying to drive us in circles but he told us that it was simply traffic which is why he changed routes. We thought he was going to pass by Kalayaan Ave. but instead he turned right on Gil Puyat Ave. which got us stuck in 30 minutes of traffic. He kept on choosing routes which are traffic and his meter is a lot faster than normal which made our P80 to P100 ride reach P150.
