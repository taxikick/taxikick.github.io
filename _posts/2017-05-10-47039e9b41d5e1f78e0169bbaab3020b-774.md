### Name of taxi: ORDINARY BGO CITY TAXI

He did not give me the Change and we took a longer route. Nag exceed ng 50 ang usual fare ko less than 1 km yung dorm ko. He seems not to know his way around at nagbabait baitan. He also pretends to not know about the roll back stuff na dapat magpapamura sa pasahe ko
