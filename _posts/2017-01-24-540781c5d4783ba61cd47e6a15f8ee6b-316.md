### Name of taxi: -

There wasn't any traffic at all and this old man wanted me to add P40. I agreed because I was rushing, and will be late for work. He changed the route and went through different side streets maybe because he wanted to charge higher. In the end, the meter read P190+ and he asked me to pay P240. I almost declined but with the time ticking, I turned my back on it. But not before getting his plate number.

```Over charging```
