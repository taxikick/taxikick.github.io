### Name of taxi: BellCab Taxi

I forgot my phone in the taxi cab. About 5 minutes later when I  realized what happened, I called my number (from another phone, of course) it rang for at least 5 times before I was met with the "unattended and out of coverage area" bullshit. I called the Maligaya Company last night several times to inquire about the driver and all they told me was "We will  just update you tomorrow Ma'am. Mag remit pa kasi sila bukas sa garage nila sa Toril. Bukas pa namin ma-contact ang manager pati driver. Mag update po kami 7am." So I waited until morning. Since 7:30 I have been calling the number which had accommodated me last night and 3 hours later WALA PA RIN RESPONSE.
