title: ACC9362 - NAIA TERMINAL 1  ARRIVAL
---

### Name of taxi: Airport Metered Taxi Service

I arrived at NAIA Terminal 1 and got a yellow metered taxi from the queue. From NAIA to Brgy San Antonio Pasig, normally it only cost me 250-350 pesos depending on traffic. It is saturday night (10pm) and traffic is really light. The final charge is 430 pesos. Almost twice as high as what I am normally charged with.

```Tampered or broken meter```
