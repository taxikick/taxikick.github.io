### Name of taxi: Not noted

I was going to work from P.Ocampo Makati to Macapagal in Pasay at around 8pm. The driver used an unfamiliar route that brought me to LaSalle area where the traffic was bumper to bumper. The worst part is that when we where in the middle of traffic, the driver asked me to just find another cab since he decided to just go home. Having no choice, i stepped out and hailed another. My usual 30min travel became 1hour and 30min. I was late for work that day loosing almost 2k in bonuses.

```Rude behavior, Out of line```
