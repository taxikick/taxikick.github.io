### Name of taxi: Im not sure if its OCTO someting not sure 

 upon entering the condo the guard already instructed to him that maneuver will be at the back before the parking area, pagkatapos po nun nagstop lang siya sa likod and expecting me to go down i told him that the entrance is not there its in the middle part of the building then he already complaint telling me that I did not gave him the instruction yet he was instructed upon entrance and hinatid na niya ako sa harap ng entrance pero nagdakdak nanaman siya na sinasabihan niya ako (ang luwag luwag dito bakit hindi ako makakapag maniubra-in a rude tone) at sinabihan ko si kuya na Sir bawal nga po dahil pagaglitan tayo ng guard but still he continued to complain then i just gave him 100 pesos but my bill was like 89 pesos only im expecting him to give me reciept but he didnt instead hinagisan nya ako ng 2 pesos not expecting it naman hinagis nya nasalo ko lang piso but then i told him that he is very rude to that to me I told him that (kuya ang salbahe mo naman pwede mo naman ibigay ng maayos bakit kelangan mo ihagis) then i did not know what he is saying na I even told him that my sister is a lawyer and I will complain him ,while I was looking at his Taxi information he got 10 peso coins (two 5 pesos) and threw it on me good thing nkaiwas na ako and he drove fastly . Though im not after the coins I dont get it why some drivers have to act so badly I was just correcting him because of the maneuver then tapos parang ako na pinagbuntungan nya . I asked the Guard to review the CCTV Camera then good thing it was still there. I just hope the he will be served with his actions soon.
