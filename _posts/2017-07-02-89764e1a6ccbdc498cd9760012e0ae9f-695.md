### Name of taxi: Unknown

It was raining so I decided to take a cab. I told the taxi driver to drop me to Gabriela Silang covered court. When we were on Gabriela silang's jeepney turning point (not the location I want to be dropped to), he said he cant go further since it is raining. He said that taxis are not allowed to go down when raining. So I walked. It was a bit far and take note I was scared because it's already dark (9:00pm). While I was walking down the road stiff road, I noticed the taxi and jeepney passing by, voila!!! THEY CAN GO DOWN THE ROAD. I AM TOTALLY PISSED FOR THIS.
