### Name of taxi: 

The bill of the taxi was 75, i have only loose bills of 70 pesos, when i gave him the money, told me that roll back was lifted as of last month, and said that i still lack 5 pesos, so i gave him 1000 and the meter turned into 78.50, and i asked for an exact change.

```Refused roll back of 10 pesos and said it was already reverted back to 40```
