title: ABH126 - naia 3 to city of dreams manila
---

### Name of taxi: ecocab

the taxi driver charged me over 1k for that ride from the exit of naia terminal 3 only a few meters away from the regular taxi station to city of dreams manila, i refuse to pay that amount even if he is shouting at me and keep on insisting that i have to pay the amount he is charging on me. i'm not sure if that is the exact name of the taxi but as far as i remembered it has an ECO on the name and i forgot the name of the driver, only the plate number i remembered..

```Over charging, No meter```
