### Name of taxi: Unknown

My girlfriend and her family flagged down the taxi, and upon stopping they told the driver where they were gonna go. The driver did not say anything so my girlfriend placed all of their things in the back of the vehicle. After loading their stuff, the driver immediately sped off. The taxi had to be chased down by kids in order to retrieve my girlfriend's items. 

```Left behind items, Malicious mischief```
