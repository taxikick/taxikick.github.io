### Name of taxi: Cant recall

It was 6:45 in the morning i got in this taxi coz im almost late this taxi driver didn’t turn the meter on so i asked him “kuya bat hindi naka metro?” He joked “bat imemetro ang haba nun” so i dint mind it muna coz nag rreview din ako then he started asking questions like if i have a boyfriend etc. and kung naughty daw ba boyfriend ko that gave me d signal i texted my tita agad the plate number then nung nasa pioneer na kami sobrang bagal ng takbo niya tas nung sa capt henry javier na lalong bumagal eh if dinerecho mo ung capt henry puro motels dun he asked for my number coz if hindi ko daw ibibigay idederecho niya dun, i gave my number since natatakot na talaga ako at malalate nako 7:20 na nun hinatid niyako sa school then inabot ko na bayad ko he declined and said “basta rreplyan moko and pag kaylangan mo ng pera text kalang” i was very humiliated I didn’t know what to do i was so scared to the point I weren’t able to take my first exam. I hope LTFRB will take an action on this one.
