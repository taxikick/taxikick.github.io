### Name of taxi: Richmelyn Taxi

We flagged the taxi from UN avenue at about 9 pm with my wife and children, before the taxi left, i informed the driver that before dropping us off to our house in Fort Bonifacio to drive us off to Villamor Pasay City to pick up my bags, there was no traffic and he only waited for 2 minutes to load my bags to. The taxi, these are 2 backpacks with only garments in it. After we left from Villamor to Fort Bonifacio, i noticed that he reverted the meter for another flag down, to which i asked why he had to do it, he said that my wife said yes to it when i was getting my bags at my aunts house in Villamor,I asked if its legal for him to do it, for this is strange to me. He said that I can ask any taxi about it. So in short i paid two flag down rates in one ride.

```Over charging```
