### Name of taxi: 

I just noticed that before he turned to Teleperformance IT Park building the fare meter was at P82.50. Then before we entered the Park Vista area it was already at P85. When we were at the guard house just 3 seconds ago from when the meter was at P85 it turned to P89. I called the attention of the driver about his fare meter but did not make any sound. Finally when we arrived at our house, while paying the meter turned to P92.50.  What the! Please call the attention of this driver and make them purchase or fix the fare meter. We might not be the only victim here.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
