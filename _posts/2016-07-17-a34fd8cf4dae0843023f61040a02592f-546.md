### Name of taxi: dollar

i ride the taxi then suddenly he turn to another way which i didnt know,  i told. him that we should go on the regular path which is in shaw blvd because at this hour 1:00 am there is no traffic but he kept on insisting that this is the shortest way until the roads are dark and no people so when i had a chance,  i throw him money and jump off the taxi when he stops at the traffic light and run through where there is lights while running,  he still followed me with the taxi and until i came with were there are people and he left.
