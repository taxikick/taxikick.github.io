title: UVN687 - Along Manggahan
---

### Name of taxi: V. MANAO / BICIVIEN

I rode the cab in Eastwood at around 8:00. While driving along Manggahan, I noticed that his meter was running fast, the sound of his meter alarmed, adding increments by the second while we're stuck in traffic. When I asked why his meter was making the sound and was running fast, he became defensive.

```Over charging, No taxi details inside```
