### Name of taxi: Unknown

Senior Citizen, 80yrs old and he chooses someone younger when I have been waiting for more than 40mins already in the right spot but he chose to sped off even if my daughter was already telling him to take us first. Shout out to the lady passenger who purposely went ahead of us and was not even considerate enough and even went to the no loading and unloading spot to get the taxi ahead of us and did not even budge or looked at us, even if my daughter was knocking on the window and ordered the taxi to sped off.
