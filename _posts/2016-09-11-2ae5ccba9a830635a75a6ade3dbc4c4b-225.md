### Name of taxi: M.G.E

I didn't notice that the amount was 211.50 pesos. I paid for just only 200 because of the plugdown rate 10 pesos. He told me that "is that 210? So I looked into the meter and then I saw its 211.50. So I gave 2 pesos in additional. He told me "Ka Bright"! So i get mad! And i threw the 2pesos in his face because of what he said! I didn't get his plate number because he just drive right after I gave the money. He opened his window and told me "walay angay" meaning I'm not good enough to do those things. So I took a picture on his taxi.
