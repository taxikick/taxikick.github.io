### Name of taxi: Unknown 

The driver did not inform me that he needed to fill the gas and I was surprised that he turned right to enter the gas station. I didn't say a word at first and just observed him. He asked a gas boy to fill the car and the way he speaks to him was very rude ("pilosopo" siya sumagot kahit sakin, pasigaw pa makipag-usap). He even sweared at the gas boy when he turned his back. The driver also had the car mirrors cleaned and he even went out of the car to clean his other mirrors. He borrowed the cleaner from the gas boy and continued the cleaning. HE WAS TAKING HIS TIME WHILE MY METER WAS RUNNING. I even told him that I needed to get somewhere on time and he didn't even have a sense of urgency like he doesn't care at all. I paid him a whole bill and he didn't even gave me an honest change but I was still waiting for it, hoping he will give it (DEDMA lang siya).  But NO, I haven't even gone out of the car when he opened his windows to call on another passenger.

```Rude behavior, Not giving exact change```
