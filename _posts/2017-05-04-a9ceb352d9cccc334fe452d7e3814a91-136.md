### Name of taxi: Unknown

I'm not really the one affected by the incident. But I saw what the taxi driver did to the exhausted passengers. The taxi was clearly empty and passengers tried to talk to the taxi driver. They haven't even opened the door of the car yet and they were refused. (Passengers were indians I think)
