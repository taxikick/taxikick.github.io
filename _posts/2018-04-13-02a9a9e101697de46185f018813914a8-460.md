### Name of taxi: Unknown

He was adjusting something below his meter which looks like a radio volume key then meter jumps 15pesos instead of 2.50 pesos. Normal charge where I am at is around 230 pesos 240 the most if heavy traffic. There was no traffic whatsoever but my fare reached up to 290 pesos

```Tampered or broken meter```
