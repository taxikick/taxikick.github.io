### Name of taxi: MGE

Me and my friend boarded the taxi with plate number indicated above. It is Saturday so it is expected to be traffic, but the said taxi was waiting for his passenger at that time, so we rode it. When we were asked where we're heading, and it was to Congressional Ave., the driver suddenly refused and told us to find other taxi, in rude attitude and very arrogant manner. Please help us find the driver of the said plate number at the time and date indicated in this report and please help me get justice to what I experienced.
