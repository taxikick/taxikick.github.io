### Name of taxi: I forgot.

We came from Victory Terminal in Pasay. It was around 5 in the morning. We were heading to Arayat St., Mandaluyong.  We were tired and all since we came from Baguio so we were a bit sleepy. Then we noticed he's heading a different direction. We asked why not EDSA? The taxi driver didn't want to pass by EDSA because he said there's traffic. It was 5AM!!! We ended up along Quirino Ave and back to Mandaluyong.
Longer travel. Higher fare.
