title: UVH?76 - From Cubao Victory Liner to Victoria Towers Timog
---

### Name of taxi: EFE

Everything was ok, and he never asked for anything. Not until I alight at my place and he mentioned plus Php50.00. I exclaimed "WHAT!" He said he mentioned it when I boarded the cab in Cubao. I said, "You never did!". In the first place, I wouldn't ride with his cab if he mentioned a plus 50...

Well, anyway, I already reported it to EFE main office and they apologized on behalf of their abusive driver. 

```Over charging```
