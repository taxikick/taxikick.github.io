title: GXH130 - Manadaue to Lapu-Lapu Bridge near Menzi

### Name of taxi: unknown

So me and my classmate going home from Parkmall Cebu to Lapu-lapu near Menzi, this time its heavy traffic and he said that we should pay 50+ pesos because in this situation so we accept the deal, after arriving we pay 100 for the standard payment plus 50 for the deal, but he refuse and exclaimed we still need to pay 100 more and thats a total of 250 pesos. Based on my own experience, if I ride a taxi from Lapu-Lapu bridge and that is still at Menzi, going to south bus terminal I always paid not more than 190 pesos at least my biggest payment is 185 pesos, now we pay 200 pesos with half a distance of what I experienced, is this right, and on the other hand, he doesn't have a meter for our payment and im sure he is just estimmating, is this valid to have a taxi like this ? Please Help and report this man!

```Over charging, No meter```
