title: UVW513 - PBS, UN Manila to PICC

### Name of taxi: Can't recall

I have already submitted a report to 09214487777 last Sunday but I wasn't sure if they have received my complaint. It is written from the drivers ID as to where complaint should be sent.

May 22nd, 2016. We took taxi from PBS, UN Avenue to PICC Forum around 1pm and yet the driver, HERVIE LOU M. MANALON, with plate number UVW513 and License No. D12-05-004-154 drove us around extending the charges.

(1) From PBS to Vito Cruz, instead of turning right, straight ahead to PICC, he turned left and drove us along Quirino. Then went back to that place for the second time and turned right where he was supposed to be going earlier. 

(2) We asked him to drop us off PICC Forum. There are three u turns allowed and after two reminders in a minute interval, he still went through the third u turn. 

Other concerns:
*At first, he refused to accept us since we are four. He want three passengers only.
*He also refused to bring us inside PICC. 

The kind of drivers like him should be taught how to be honest with their customers. I was a little lucky I know the path he was driving so I was able to recognize he is driving us back and forth which is extending the bills.

Hope you'd take action on this. Thank you!
