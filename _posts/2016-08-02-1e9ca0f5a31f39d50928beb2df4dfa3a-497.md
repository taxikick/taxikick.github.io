title: TXH374 - FROM rosario c.raymundo pasig to Robinson's galleria
---

### Name of taxi: TRAFALGAR TAXI (Im not sure if its 374 but Im sure that the first alpha letters are TXH and it belongs to trafalgar taxi,has a sticker of EasyTaxi on the right window)

the taxi driver overcharged me from 93php (metred fare) to 130php from c.raymundo to Robinson's Galleria. He did not give the right chaange to my  500peso bill due to his reason that he has not enough money to give me change. So I ask the driver to wait while I go to the fast food resto beside the road to have my 500php exchange to a smaller bill. Then right after I handed this taxi driver 150php versus my metred fare 93php. he then just gave me 20 pesos and galit pa sya. Rude taxi driver and the taxi is old and the seats are dirty with lots of stains also foul odor inside his taxi. (Note: the taxi has a Easy taxi sticker on its right window)  

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
