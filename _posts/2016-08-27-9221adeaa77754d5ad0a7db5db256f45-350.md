### Name of taxi: M.G.E

I travelled from Trinoma Mall to QC with my wife and 1 year kid. Driver was too drunk and left us near my place and asked for blank 100php to which i asked how much is meter and he refused to say and said its not working.Completely drunk he was started shouting in middle of street and threatened to take us somewhere else to teach me a lesson.
I will report to police about this too,please take corrective action asap.

```Over charging, No meter```
