### Name of taxi: Unknown 

When I got off bus drop off point there where about 12 taxis approx 5.45 am. I ask 1st 4 Taxi to take me to Avida Towers in Sucat, they all asked for 400 or 500 pesos, I asked why as you have a meter, they all tell me they are contract taxis.
They have a captive passengers with many buses stopping there. 
I walked over the walkway and got a Taxi for 300 pesos to Sucat.
Those taxis are there every morning to scamp people.
It high time something was done about these crocodile Taxis.
If good honest taxi driver you all ways give tip to say thank you for being honest with me.

```Over charging```
