### Name of taxi: Saint Sebastian

He was on queue in taxi bay so when it was my turn to ride, it was his turn. He asked where is my destination, i said Dasmariñas Cavite. Then he started to complain that its too far. So i said, what do you want me to do? Shall i go down. He didnt answer and just continue driving but keep complaining. He said he will waste his time and gasoline going there. So i asked again, shall i go down? But he didnt stop the car. I am so excited to go home to see my kids but this driver ruined my day with his very negative personality. Aren’t he really needs time and gasoline to earn money as a driver??? How come he is complaining??? This kind of people has no right to be in their position because they dont appreciate that customers are their life to earn money. This is very different from other country where the drivers will just ask your destination and take you there safely, with no complaints at all. I hope only responsible drivers can have space on the road. Thank you
