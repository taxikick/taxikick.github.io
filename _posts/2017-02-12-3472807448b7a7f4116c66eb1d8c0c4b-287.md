title: ABG7903 - UST to CASH & CARRY
---

### Name of taxi: J.L.Junio

From UST to CASH & CARRY, i asked that we pass by Loyola then to San Marcelino so as to evade the traffic on Espana south and northbound. He insisted that we take Nagtahan, even after seeing the traffic on Espana. I noticed that he'd prefer going fast and then going to an almost complete stop during bumper to bumper traffic, rather than just moving at an average speed...when i noticed that he seems to do it on purpose so the STOP METER on the taxi (which only runs when the taxi is in a complete stop) would run as much as possible. What made it worse was that the stop meter, which should drop 1 second every second (duh), would drop up to 4 seconds per 1 second. Imagine i was riding the cab for 20 minutes, and my stop meter says we have been sitting in traffic for 24 minutes. He insisted that the LTO has not been tampered at all, and even turned the meter off as soon as i started complaining.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
