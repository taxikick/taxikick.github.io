title: AYV310 - Baguio city
---

### Name of taxi: Salam

It happened between 6:40-7pm, jan. 21(sunday). Driver was driving really fast, nakikipagkarera pa sa jeep. Endless overtaking for no reason. And to think the terrain of Baguio does not call for extremely fast speeds, especially when the traffic is irregular. Ang bilis niya talaga. Also, his id wasn't displayed. His appearance: dark-skinned, thin, probably between 35-45 years old, and wearing a striped bonnet at that time.

```Reckless driving```
