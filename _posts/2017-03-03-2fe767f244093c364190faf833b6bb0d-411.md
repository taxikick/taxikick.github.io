### Name of taxi: AMPTAX

We rode this taxi between 4:20 to 4:30PM and as soon as all our baggage 1 grocery box 1 grocery and 1 school bag the driver asked for my destination which is approx 1.48km(Polaris Felipe St).Driver instantly asked for addtl P50 charge.I refused and said i only had exact amount to pay for my fare which i usually pay bet P70-P80 with traffic already.Driver kept on making excuses so i told him to just dropped us to the nearest taxi stand so we can get another ride.Driver dropped as in Glorietta 3 taxi stand.Ive felt that paying extra charge on a metered taxi is as if i was being robbed and I cant tolerate such unacceptable act.He kept on reasoning and even implied that i was lying on him charging extra P50.I will not go through the hassle considering I am with my 7 yo daughter.Driver continued with his unreasonable talk.He just stopped when i told him i will complain him in LTFRB. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
