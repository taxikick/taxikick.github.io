### Name of taxi: Forgot

We were wIting for a cab at 10:00am The driver stopped infront of us then when I stood infront of the door to open, He shouted " Pas-pasan Nyo ah"...it was a suprised.  then he rushed his taxi going up to QM.  He never waited for so long. Not even 5 seconds.  he was arrogant! My visitors from Manila now says..."sabi nila mabait driver dto Baguio"...now because of this guy...all the drivers are labelled inappropriately... One more, his did not even care that a child is about to board when he showed up his NAPAKA BASTOS ATTITUDE... I am very ashamed of what he did because yesterday, I told them that Our city is tourist friendly....well, experiencing this shows different story.

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
