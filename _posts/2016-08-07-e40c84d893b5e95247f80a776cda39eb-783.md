### Name of taxi: Rezuan Taxi

Just earlier this evening of August 7,2016 Sunday,i board at this Rezuan Taxi with plate number ALA4678 just outside our gate's subdivision in Filinvest 2.I thought everything is all set because i was inside the taxi already.I was in a hurry then as it is about to rain and im just recovering from fever.The driver then ask me,metro po ba? Then i replied "syempre po" then the driver ask me "what time is it? I told him its 7:30. He then told me that he might not go drive anymore because its late or if i want we can go but i need to add 100 pesos on top of the metred bill.i told him no and id rather use grabcar.while waiting for my grabcar the driver approached me in condescending voice asking why am i getting angry,i then told him that i dont want to talk to him and that we will settle this in an appropriate time and location.he got provoked i guess because he saw me listing his taxi's plate number and name on my phone.im so scared that night and very much stressed.he is a very rude person and i want him to learn his lesson to be courteous.very bad and rude yaxi driver!
