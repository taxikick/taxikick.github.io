### Name of taxi: Anzen

After I got in, taxi driver said we'd use the meter but "bahala na daw ako sa dagdag". I said, what's the use of the meter if it won't be used properly. He was also talking to someone on the phone half the trip and was shouting. Meter was 89Php. I gave him 100Php and no change was given back to me.

```Rude behavior, Texting while driving```
