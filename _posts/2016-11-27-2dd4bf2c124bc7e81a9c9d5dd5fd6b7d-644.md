### Name of taxi: Unknown

Taxi driver wants to follow his own route when we (me and my friends) have a specific itinerary. He wants to have his own way, very rude manners. He said he "does not want to be stuck with the same passengers for too long". I want to be dropped in Ayala, my friends in SM City. But he does not want to be hassled by the long route so he went his own way and dropped us all in SM city. I have to catch another cab to Ayala as I have an urgent appointment.

```Rude behavior```
