### Name of taxi: Unknown

I regularly ride a cab everyday since my schedule is at 3am. Normally, I only pay less than and not greater than 100.00 pesos, from Pasay MRT-31st St BGC. Edsa-Kalayaan Route. Early this morning when I rode a cab, I paid for 128.00 pesos, when normally I only pay for a hundred. I told him: "Kuya, may mali sa metro mo. Everyday ako sumasakay ng taxi ngayon lang ako nagbayad ng 128.00. Ipacheck mo yan." He immediately ran away. 

```Over charging```
