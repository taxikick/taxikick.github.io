title: UVV833 - StarCity

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Me and my girlfriend took a cab near heritage hotel going to Star City. My girlfriend asked how much from heritage hotel pasay to Star City. The taxi driver said that depends on the meter. So we took that cab. I was wondering why the meter is running differently than those of other cab. So I asked the driver. He said that its the same meter as any other taxi. KILOMETER based is what he said. Then when we got to star city I caught a glimpse of the meter saying 78 pesos, but after he clicked some buttons on the meter WE WERE CHARGED 343php! HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE?!  The distance and how long we travel is the same as how long it took us if we took a cab from buendia ave to glorietta. There wasn't any ID in the cab. He gave us a receipt even after he said that there wasn't any paper. BUT THE RECEIPT WASN'T CLEAR. still we didn't give him the 343php. we handed him 120. The driver has a tattoo on his right arm. The driver probably thought that we're kids or something. PLEASE TAKE ACTION ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I want this guy out. Because I'm sure that he will keep on trying to do the same to others. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
