### Name of taxi: Spider Taxi

Hi ! Good day !

I'm writing to file a complaint against Spider Taxi in Cebu City for possibly having a tampered meter.

the body of the taxi has a number 3915 on it.

I normally take a taxicab home during 4.am when I get home from work ( at a time when there's very little traffic).

Normally, I would pay less than 150.00php. But today, I payed almost 210.00php which is drastically higher .

The driver was also rude, and pretended not to know the normal route.

Kindly look into this, because I have already  heard a lot of negative feedback about Spider Taxi .
