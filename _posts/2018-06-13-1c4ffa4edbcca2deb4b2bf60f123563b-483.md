title: ABQ1408 - Eton Centris to Hulo Mandaluyong

### Name of taxi: VSCO

Driver asked for additional 50, I agreed. No problem. However, noticed that waiting time is very fast that usual. My reciept reflected that my ride is around 50-52 minutes with wait time 25 mins and 26 seconds. So that means 11.7 km only took 27 mins running time. Mentioned to the driver that meter was fast, he just ignored me.

```Tampered or broken meter, Contracting```
