### Name of taxi: Didnt take note

We took a taxi from Naia Terminal 1 to pasay rotunda that was supposed to go to genesis terminal. When we got inside he all of a sudden said the rate is 150 per kilometer..for a short distance we ended up paying 800.We couldnt get down because the car was already moving when we daid the price and was scared he would take us somewhere else if we didnt abide.

```Over charging, No receipt```
