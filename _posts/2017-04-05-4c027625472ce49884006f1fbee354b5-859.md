### Name of taxi: Unknown

My two neices took a taxi from SM Consolacion and asked the driver to bring them to a water refilling station to pick-up 3 water bottles. When it is about time to get off, (1st complaint)  the driver did not give the change & without explanation. The passengers asked him to drop of the 3 bottles at the exact doorsteps but he did not listened & continue to offload the bottles at the wrong house (2nd complaint). (3rd complaint) When i went outside the house, I asked the driver to explain what happened & he was so rude. He said that he did not give the change because it is considered two routes. To which i told him, that the reason why we took a taxi in the first place was for him to help us pick-up the bottles. Another thing is that, he dis not even listened to us as to where to offload the bottles. We dont have men inside the house to do help us. The taxi driver is very rude.
