### Name of taxi: forgot

we try to give the exact amount flagdown rate of 10 pesos howerer the driver shout and was rude at us saying that there is no longer flagdown rate. To avoid the fight we just gave the anount he asked and after we get out the cab he immediately drove the cab violently and still shouting.

```Over charging, No receipt```
