### Name of taxi: TAxi

Driver picked the passenger from Cybergate 1, he was told to drop to Pan Pacific Manila. Driver took the routes which are longer and intentionally let the meter readings to higher to charge more. He was passing mischievous comments and  bad remarks to ongoing girls. He pretended not to know the way and let the lonely woman passenger tense about the situation and eventually reaching office late.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
