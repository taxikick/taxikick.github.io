### Name of taxi: PRIDE OF ACRON

Its really late and no taxis are around. When this taxi came we hailed him and crossed the road. As we get close to him he asked first where we want to go, then we told him we want to be dropped just 3 kms away at West Rembo, Makati normally costing 50php below on a regular taxi ride. Before we even touched the door handle, the driver asked for a fixed fare of Php150.00 but when we said its not allowed he immediately drove away.
