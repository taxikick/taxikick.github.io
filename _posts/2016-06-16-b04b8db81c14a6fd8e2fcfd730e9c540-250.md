### Name of taxi: AKRAM taxi

I noticed that his meter is not running and he said that he will drive me to work in Cubao for 250. I told him I only pay 190 to 200 daily but he didn't comment. He dropped me off in front of our office lobby and I gave him 200 but he refused and asked me more. I said I can easily report him to our security, he then asked me to get off his cab. 

```Over charging, No meter```
