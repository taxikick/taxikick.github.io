title: UYA166 - FTI Taguig going to MOA
---

### Name of taxi: M.G.E

First, He doesn't know how to go to moa from fti taguig and the proper lane to stay. From express way he go straight going to buendia and not sure were we was. Second, We almost got hit by the jeepney on both left and right side becuse, his not looking at the side mirrors and it happened for twice. Third: The way he drive it's so annoying and dangerous some how, I was wondering if he is a real taxi driver because, the way he breaks and start the engine it's he never drive before or just recently learned how to drive.
