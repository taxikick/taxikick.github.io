### Name of taxi: Ponte Elmor, Shamme/ FLSP Taxi

Got down from Genesis Bus, Pasay. Taxi was there, I ask if he has a Meter w/ Receipt, he said Yes, No further negotiations happens. I got in the Taxi at exactly 11:57pm, we arrived at MOA abt 10-15min later. He handed me the receipt & to my Surprise, it says P145.00, so I asked the driver abt it & he just said "Di ko ba nasabi ma'am, P150 pamasahe at naka pila ako"... I was about to argue with him even more, but since it was late at night and I have a kid with me, I just paid the P150 & got off the Taxi. When I later examined the receipt, it really was indeed the taxi's but, this receipt was actually taken earlier that day at exactly 6:56-7:31a.m. (probably taken/metered from the garage & saved to use to exploit people)
This happened to me before like 5x already, from Coastal mall going to the Airport & vice versa. By asking for a Receipt I was hoping I could avoid this Greedy drivers but obviously, these people have way to many tricks up their sleeves just to exploit people...

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
