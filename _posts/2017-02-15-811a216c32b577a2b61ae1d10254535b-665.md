### Name of taxi: Cannot be clearly seen on video.

(Event was captured by on board car CCTV)
When the green light to turn left was flashed on the intersection of F. Torres St, JP. Laurel Street and Loyola street (Davao city), I was patiently waiting for the vehicle in front me to move forward, but when vehicle in front me was able to traverse for a few meters, the taxi that was on the right side of my vehicle and which was located at the right side lane (the lane which was supposed to be used to turn right to JP Laurel street / going to Gaisano Mall) suddenly shifted to the left and cutting in front of my vehicle in order to turn left.
