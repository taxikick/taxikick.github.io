### Name of taxi: Richielda Taxi

Had a two way trip from ayala to the back of usc south. The driver demanded a plus 40 and refused to let the meter start again. Plus he had a rude behavior of making route choices that lengthens the travel. My second ride was on its way to cogon pardo. Upon arriving I gave 200 php as payment for the meter price of 150 php. The bald driver gave a 10 php change. researched on fb and found the taxi company's page and driver the same time, his name is Edward Oropeza.
