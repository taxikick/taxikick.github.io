### Name of taxi: Unknown

I boarded the taxi from Mckinley Hill at around 11:30pm. When I arrived at the destination around 11:45pm, the fare in the meter is Php138. I paid Php200, and asked for Php70 change. The driver received the money and said, "Anong 70? 60." I didnt respond because I dont wanna get angry and be involved in a fight. The actual fare should be only Php128 since there's a flag down rate of Php10. 

He violated two things: 1. Didnt give exact change.
2. Rude the way he responded.

```Not giving exact change, No flag down of meter```
