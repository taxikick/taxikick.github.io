### Name of taxi: Zhechivan taxi

When we ride in we heard him said "P100 lng." So we refused and said that we would pay him per meter instead. And he shouted "Sabi Ko dahandahan Lang kasi sira ang salamin..pagbayarin ko pa Kau nyan Eh." He arrogantly said those things in rudely, but my sister even apologized and said "sorry". When we got out we told him "ayusin nya Salamin nya bago sya pumasada.." He go out of his car while we're opening the gate and arrogantly shouted that he owned that taxi if we want we buy our own.. And he threatened to attack us. His full name was Christopher Bacalso Tanaya. Please do something as we were traumatized by this incident. 

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
