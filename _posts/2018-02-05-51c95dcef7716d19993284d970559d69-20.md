### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was informed by the attendant at the regular taxi stand that my taxi driver would use meter but when we left airport i asked taxi driver why he was not using meter.  He informed me that only the standard fare is used leaving airport. Needless to say he charged me P650 for a 15 minute 5.2 kilometer ride. As a tourist this is hardly a good introduction to the Philippines.

```Over charging```
