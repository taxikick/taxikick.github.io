### Name of taxi: MGE

The driver agreed to take the 5 of us in his taxi without any agreement that there will be any additional payments as we were 5 passengers. Then when he drop us in our destination, the fare is only P71.50 then we gave P100. Then we asked for a change of P20, even if we still have P28.50 as change. Then the driver suddenly said that because we are 5 passengers, there is an additional P30. It's so annoying!

```Over charging, No receipt```
