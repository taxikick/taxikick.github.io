### Name of taxi: Feliefrans

Prior to boarding he said I need to pay 50 pesos extra going to mandaluyong but i said it is only 7km and he needs to bring me back. Then after dropping my daughter to her destination he told me that i need to add the flagdown rate. I asked why considering that it is just 1 trip. He said in a rude manner, "gusto ninyo bumaba na lang kyo at kumuha kayo ng ibang taxi". So i just kept quiet since the place is a little remote and finding taxi will not be easy. In otherword, I paid 58.50 extra since he said he has no change. Diver's name is Daniel Catapia. Hope i got it right since the ID was placed on the dashboard & i hv to peek wtout him knowing it.
