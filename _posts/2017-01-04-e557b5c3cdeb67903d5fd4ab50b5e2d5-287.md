### Name of taxi: AIRPORT METERED YELLOW TAXI

I always use this taxi service in the said route. But this time, the meter went up to 315 pesos. Normally, the fare is just around 150 to 200 pesos. When im about to disembark, i mentioned to the driver that there is something wrong in his meter. With this remark, he slashed 15 pesos off from the fare according to the meter, which just shows that it is anomalous...

```Over charging, No taxi details inside```
