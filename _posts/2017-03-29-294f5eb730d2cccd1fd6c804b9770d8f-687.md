title: AKA2355 - NAIA Airport - Ermita, Manila

### Name of taxi: Unknown

I took a taxi at NAIA to Ermita, Manila. On our way out of NAIA, the driver charged me 600 pesos (no meter). I refused to pay the amount and asked him to use the meter. He refused and dropped me not far from the airport to get another cab. But before that, he let me pay 60 pesos.

```Over charging, No meter```
