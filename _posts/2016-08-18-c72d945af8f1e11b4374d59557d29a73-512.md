### Name of taxi: Grab Taxi 

Taxi driver is so liar and greedy with money. He didn't gave me any change even the smallest bill. He kept on insisting that he doesn't had small bills for change, though i was just asking even the smallest bill that I saw on his hand. I tried to go to the nearest convenient store to buy some goods so I can pay him but he did refuse again and act like he was in rush hour (around 10pm?). Instead, he grabbed his phone and started to accept other customer (via Grab Taxi App) while I'm still in. He rushed and forced me to pay him right away because the other customer is waiting for him. I've had no chance but to give it away the 200 peso bill. That was so disgusting! I am very disappointed the whole day! There's no consideration I saw from that Grab Taxi Driver that I encountered. DON'T patronize GRAB TAXI or else you get frustrated! They don't often give you a chance to get the right change that you deserve. That driver is so impolite. Hope you get rich by having all the change/s you refused to give to your passengers!!!
