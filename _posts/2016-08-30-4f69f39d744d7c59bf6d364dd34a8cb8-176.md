### Name of taxi: ?

At the destination the meter read 71 pesos. I paid the driver 61 pesos and left. Then he called after me and wanted more money (the meter by this time said 75 pesos). I told him the meter went up after he had been paid already. He then shouted, " FUCK YOU'. Disgraceful behaviour.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
