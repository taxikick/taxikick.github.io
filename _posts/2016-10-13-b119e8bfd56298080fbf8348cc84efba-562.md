### Name of taxi: Envirocab

When the taxi driver agreed to my destination from Market Market Taguig to Santolan Pasig, he then told me that he will charge extra 50 and so I agreed. When we arrived to my destination, the meter was at 187. So I deducted 10 from the meter and added 50. So, I gave him 227. He said it should be 240, and I told him I am deducting 10 and giving exact fare only. He showed a rude gesture and so I am forced to report him. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
