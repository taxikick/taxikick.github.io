### Name of taxi: not sure

taxi cut queue in naia terminal 3 from the usual taxi stand. Before i got in there were already arguments with the taxi infont of me.The guard did not say anything .The taxi driver threw some money and it was okay.But the cab driver did not tell me it is an airport taxi with the meter charging 10 pesos per kilometer?what nonsense. And i was heading to valenzuela .He was being so rude and tried to con me .So i decided to get down but i had to pay 200 pesos since it was already 2kms.He is not honest.Please do something.As he is trying to con unsuspected passengers.No details what so ever saying it was a airport taxi as the departure are only for regular taxis.I have been here for 9 years and this was just plain absurd. 

```Over charging, Contracting```
