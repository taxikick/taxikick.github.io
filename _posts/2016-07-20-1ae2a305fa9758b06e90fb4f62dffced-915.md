### Name of taxi: BLL Taxi

When we entered the taxi, driver asked for additional 50 pesos. I noticed his meter also ran faster and inconsistently. Im also not sure if this is the actual plate number because it's what it said inside but it has 1 number more than the usual.

```Tampered or broken meter, Contracting```
