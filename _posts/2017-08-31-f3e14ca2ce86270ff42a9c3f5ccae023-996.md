### Name of taxi: Reyginel

I got into the taxi and told the driver my destintion. He was asking for an additional P50. I refused and just put my earphones on. I can see in his face through the rearview mirror that he was pissed. To get back at me:
1. He stopped at a gas station to gas up even though he still had half a tank full.
2. He drove at 5-10km/hr even though the road was already clear. (I wasn't really in a hurry so it's okay)
3. He turned the radio and the aircondition off (i just slightly opened the window)
4. He refused to give me a receipt and immediately sped off when i gave him the EXACT amount of the fee.

```Contracting, No receipt```
