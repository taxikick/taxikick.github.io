### Name of taxi: unknown

1/20/17 1650h Boarded the taxi and was informed by the driver that traffic was heavy and that I should just tell him how much I am willing to pay. I told him to turn on the meter and he said I need to pay additional on top of the meter amount. I just told him no and immediately alighted the taxi.

```No meter, Contracting```
