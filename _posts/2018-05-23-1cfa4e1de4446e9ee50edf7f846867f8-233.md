### Name of taxi: Erjohn Taxi

Mr. Mordeno was on his phone when I hailed his cab. We started the trip and he was unable to start the meter right away. After about a hundred meters, he ended his call. He started the meter and asked where in BGC was my destination. I was surprised that he made another call and was talking so loudly. He was shouting and I was seated just beside him. Also, it was hot inside the cab.

```Reckless driving, No seatbelts```
