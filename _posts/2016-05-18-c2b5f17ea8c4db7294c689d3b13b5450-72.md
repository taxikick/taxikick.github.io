### Name of taxi: Jeruel Trans

first of all the taxi refused the first person in line and i asked if he is okay in proj.4 he agreed and when we start moving he said P100 cant argue anymore because we are already in the taxi, plus my mothers really tired of waiting in line, so i agreed. but thats not right, he should use his meter all the time and not take advantage of the heavy rain, i think he used the heavy rain and people are waiting in line for hours so that he can overprice and say whatever price he wants. i just got the drivers name, RANDY C. PABLO and the operator cellphone number 09985102928 and the company JERUEL TRANS. i hope we can fix this and teach the driver a lesson also the operator so that he manages his drivers properly.
