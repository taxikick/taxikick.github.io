### Name of taxi: Cannot remember

Cab driver started shouting at me when I gave him the directions to where he is supposed to drop me off
Most taxi drivers are not familiar with the place that's why I usually give directions
Then he started shouting and saying, "Dapat kasi sinabi mo na kung saan yung lugar, na-stuck pa tayo rito sa stoplight. Kung sana sinabi mo, sana dumiretso na ako. Yung ibang mga pasahero, pinagmumukhang tanga yung ibang taxi drivers eh."

```Rude behavior```
