### Name of taxi: M.G.E.

Well when we asked to go to Geneva Garden Labayani he asked us to charge overcharge 120 but the usual when we drove is only less than 100 pesos kaya please wag na ganito ng klase sa mga taxi drivers ayaw ko talaga na ganito sana improve at lalo mabait sa mga drivers in this time thank you!

```Refused boarding, Over charging```
