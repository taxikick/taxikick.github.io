### Name of taxi: Unknown

It was around 1 am and were about to enter our village the driver almost hit a guy who is walking at the side of the street. The guy shouted "P***ng *na!" And then the driver stopped and shouted back "P***ng *na mong g*g* ka!! Barilin kita dyan e!" I was so nervous but i tried to ignore what just happened. And so as we approached the street near to my house there is this 2 cars parked in each side of the street. He asked me that he couldn't fit in and so i handed him 150 pesos with the total bill of 131 pesos. He was disappointed because he has no change and so i decided to get out of the car and walk my way to our house. Then as i walking i turned my back and saw the cab making his way through the narrowed street. I was so scared that night. I hope you could take an immediate action to this incident.
