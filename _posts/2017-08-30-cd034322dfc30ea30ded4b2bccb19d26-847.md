### Name of taxi: Unknown

After i was declined by several taxi drivers, i thought i was lucky because one driver agreed to take me to my destination without even hesitating or asking for an "additional" fee. However, i was completely wrong. He drove recklessly; i could no longer count how many vehicles we almost bumped into- side, front or rear; and almost all types of vehicles. It turned out he was watching a movie thru his phone displayed on his dashboard.
All throughout the ride, he kept on complaining; that's why i decided to give him instructions on "shortcuts" (i know a lot of shortcuts going home coz i drive my own car), but instead of "appreciation" he was too rude to follow my instructions and kept on answering back. I held on to my anger because i was afraid he might do something bad. When i reached home, my bill was P250 from the usual P180 (not to mention we dropped by to a gas station that took us 15 mins while his meter was already on),i gave P500 but only received a change of P200... i tried to get my P500 back and give him P250 plus P20 tip instead but he refused to give it back and said "ang layo nito".  I was Too tired to argue anymore so i let it be but kept on my mind that i will report this guy so he can learn his lesson and will no longer be able to take advantage over other people.
