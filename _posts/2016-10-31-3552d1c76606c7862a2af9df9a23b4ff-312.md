### Name of taxi: Unknown

On my way to work, Eastwood, Cybermall. I checked the taxi's meter it was 47.00 it was about right until we reach front street of Eastwood when it became 125.00 when I don't even exceed 70.00 (usually pay 65 or 68).

Taxi driver said do not mind the meter as he forgot to renew it. He said just pay him 100 pesos instead. I refuse to pay 100 but offered him 70 pesos as that is my usual bill from Dela Paz, Pasig to Eastwood, Cybermall. He accepts it then leave.

```Over charging```
