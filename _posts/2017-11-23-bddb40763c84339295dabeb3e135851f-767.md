### Name of taxi: Forgot sorry, but it's color white

I am at Gil Puyat that time, then I rode the taxi telling him that I need to go to Makati Medical Center. Then he said, okay it will only take us 10 minutes. I noticed that there was no meter reading, when I told him he said that it's automatic, a receipt will come out. Since I am not familiar with the places, he dropped me somewhere in Filmore st. near a mall and then told me that the hospital is just across that building. HE then asked me to pay 250.00!! I was surprised because the distance didn't take us more than 10 minutes. When I refused he said in an anger tone that he is an airport taxi, and that is how he should be paid. I just gave in because I was afraid that he might assault me since I sat on the front seat. The worst thing is that, the hospital is nowhere to be found in that area, and a guard told me that it was still far.

```Over charging, No meter```
