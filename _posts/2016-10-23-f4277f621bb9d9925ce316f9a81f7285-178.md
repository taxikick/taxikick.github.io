title: UYB739 - Zapote Las Pi√±as to Katipunan Ave cor Aurora Blvd
---

### Name of taxi: Renato

Charged 800 pesos from Zapote LP to Katipunan on an early Sunday morning trip with no traffic, without warning he was not going to turn on the meter. We know it costs 450 from Katip to Las Pinas on a night trip with moderate traffic. He looked and talked like an addict so we let him get away with it even though I am so angered (it is a family day so we chose not to argue). 

```Over charging, No meter```
