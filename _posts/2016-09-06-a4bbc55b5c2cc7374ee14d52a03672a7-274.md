### Name of taxi: I forgot to get the name.

I have a doubt that his meter was tampered, because I always ride a cab from gilmore to wilson circle, just a few blocks ahead of cardinal santos and its just cost 80-90pesos, but today my fare in his taxi went up to 106pesos considering that theres no traffic today. Based on googlemap it just 4km. 

```Tampered or broken meter```
