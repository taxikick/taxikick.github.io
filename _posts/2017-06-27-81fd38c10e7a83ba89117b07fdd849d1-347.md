### Name of taxi: DESA TAXI

From the Casa Bocobo hotel to NAIA Terminal 1 airport the driver charged me and my Japanese friends P500 pesos and kept insisting it was because of "traffic" which was not even apparent during our car ride. He agreed to bring it down to P350

```Over charging, No meter```
