### Name of taxi: Not Sure

This Driver asked us for the location and we said "Bicutan lang kuya". He tried to contract us and asked how much then my friend told "150" because it is the usual rate for the taxi since its near we became familiar on the rates since we always ride taxi to go to work. Then Kuya replied "150? Diyan Diyan lang yan". Kuya is too picky and bad attitude.
