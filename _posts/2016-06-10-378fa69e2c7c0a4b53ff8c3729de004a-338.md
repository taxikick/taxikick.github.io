### Name of taxi: Kaolin Taxi

Taxi driver (Ricky T) refused to give me my change, claiming that he didn't have coins to give me. He was insisting that it be tip instead, despite the fact that I was already giving him already a tip on top of the flagdown rollback.

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
