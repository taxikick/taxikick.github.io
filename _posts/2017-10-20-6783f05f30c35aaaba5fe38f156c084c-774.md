### Name of taxi: M.G.E

We rode in market market, we ask the driver to head to masinag, and the driver sounded pissed, then when we ask driver to drop one of us near hyper market he sounded more pissed, and when we ask him if it’s ppssible to drop me in megamall instead, while my husband would still be dropped in masinag, he commanded us to pay additional 70pesos even if we are using meter, then he said, “ or if you want 50 only but I will drop you in Megamall both” then we just decided to alight in IPI because he’s becoming very rude and arrogant already

```Rude behavior```
