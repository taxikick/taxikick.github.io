### Name of taxi: Bern

We are waiting for a metered taxi lane in NAIA terminal 2 and  this taxi came. We rode and ask the driver to take us at baclaran church. We noticed that the meter has not turned on and ask the driver to turn it on. He answered "250 ang bayad pa baclaran". Then we ask him to stop but he didnt. Then he stopped the cab when we reach the highway and let us walk far back to the airport. This is not the first time that's why im writing this to advise everyone to be careful in choosing any means of transportation

```No meter, Contracting```
