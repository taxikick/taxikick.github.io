### Name of taxi: Mtec

Meter was runnung very fast.  It is 17km from NAIA TERMINAL 4 to Festival Mall.  We were charged P500.  Flag down is 70 for first 500 meters but his meter runnuning as soon as we left the terminal.  The meter was already 120 just from the Terminal 4 to the gas station at the corner.  We are supposed to be charged 4 for every 300M but it appears to be more like every 200 meters.  This meter was tampered.

```Over charging```
