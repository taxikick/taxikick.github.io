### Name of taxi: 

The driver did not have a meter and charged us 150 php for a 61 peso ride to the club thinking we were too drunk to take note. When we asked to get his name he said he "forgot" and proceeded to say "fuck you" to us passengers. Further, he was impolite and rude when we tried to point out the absurdity of the 3-5 minute ride's price. 

```Over charging, No meter```
