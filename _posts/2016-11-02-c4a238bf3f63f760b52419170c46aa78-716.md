### Name of taxi: Unknown

This taxi driver has a very rude behavior. He doesnt want to give exact change to us. He mentioned that he doesnt have the exact change for our bill but we have already seen that he has too much cash and coins. He is very rude and if you dont give extra tip, he complains. He has uncontrollable anger problems and his taxi smells. He didnt even mention that we have a 10 pesos flagdown but still insisted us to give more than the metered fare. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
