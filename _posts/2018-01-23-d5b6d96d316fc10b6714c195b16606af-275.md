### Name of taxi: Unknown 

Over speeding, overtaking recklessly that we almost got in an accident with another vehicle he was trying to needlessly overtake. When told to slow down, he still drove fast either way, without consideration for the passengers request. He also refused to give his ID when requested. 
The ID that I saw was something like a Rhandal A. Lattore 

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
