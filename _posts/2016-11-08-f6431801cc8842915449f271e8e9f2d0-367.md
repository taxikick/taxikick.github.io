### Name of taxi: Red Acel Transport

he driver was listening to a basketball game when we entered the cab, I gave him the building name and the exact address. Upon reaching Makati, he was about to drop us off at the wrong place. Then he started mumbling to which I mentioned our destination again. I started to take note of taxi details at this point. He had no ID displayed. The meter showed 115 when we stopped and so we gave him 150, asking for only 20 change. He returned the 50, so we thought it was okay. When we went down, he was suddenly shouting and we gave him the 50 stressing we don't have the 15 (given that we owe him 5 because of the rollback). He didn't get the 50 but he started taunting us
