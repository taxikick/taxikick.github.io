### Name of taxi: Chris Madz Taxi

I got inside the taxi and then when i told the driver my destination, he said that i need change taxi because he doesnt want to go to corinthians village because it is traffic. He told me also to use his name when i file complaint. Driver is so arrogant when he said that. His name is Zaldy Santos
