title: TYX727 - On Makati Avenue - after the Kalayan and Makati Avenue intersection, while coming from General Luna Street

### Name of taxi: Not sure - it’s the white metered taxi

I was coming back home with my family after a dinner at RICH in General Luna Street. My apartment is at the Tordesillas Street and its should not take more than 50 Peso from Kalayan - Makati Avenue intersection. It was 9:50 pm and this taxi driver stopped and picked me, my wife and two kids. There was traffic on the road and I immediate asked his to put on on meter, which he refused and told me that I would have to pay him 100 Peso to go to Tordesillas Street. Upon my consistent request to put on the Meter, he asked us to go out of the taxi. When I told him that i would report this incidence to the Police; he laughed and told me “Cops can’t do anything to me” and sped off!
