### Name of taxi: JOHN MATTHEW

Taxi was cut by a private vehicle which upset the taxi driver. He went all out aggressive and offensive on the road. I was pleading him to just leave it be and if he could just let me out of the car. He kept on his crazy driving as if not hearing anything. He finally hit the brakes at a traffic light at which i immediately got off the taxi. I was so scared. 

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
