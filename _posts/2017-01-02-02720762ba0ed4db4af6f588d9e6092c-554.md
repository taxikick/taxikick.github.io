title: UWD442 - Cityland to Makati Medical Center ER
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was with may almost 2 year old daughter hailing a cab. This cab stopped and asked where we are heading. I said to Makati Medical Center. He did not say anything but refused to board us. My concern is that, we are going to the hospital. Doesnt it sound like an emergency for him that he refused to board. To think that it is only 10 to 15mins away from our house. It is an emergency yet they refuse passengers.

```Refused boarding```
