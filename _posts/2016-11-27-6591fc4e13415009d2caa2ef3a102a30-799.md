title: ATA544 - Fort Bonifacio Taguig City
---

### Name of taxi: Richmelyn Taxi

We flagged the taxi from UN Avenue in Manila at about 9 pm, before we left I told him that we will pick 2 bags and 2 small boxes filled with childrens clothes  in Villamor Pasay City before heading to our house,there were no traffic jams we encountered at any point along the way and he only waited for 2 minutes to pick up my bags and loaded it to the taxi, I just noticed that after a few minutes of driving from Villamor to Fort Bonifacio that the fare is only more than 40 pesos to which I asked  why it has reverted as if we took a new ride, he said that my wife consented while I was getting the bags from my Aunts place, he even said that " kahit kanino nyo pa itanong, ganyan talaga pag may dinaanan ka sa ibang lugar" my wife silenced me to just go along with it as it is only 40 pesos, I dont mind the amount but my issue is IS IT LEGAL? And by the way I tooked a picture of the Taxis plate number, Theres a zero at the end, as your app only allows 3 digit number right after the 3 digit letters, so my pictures tell me its ATA 5440 As the picture was not very clear as he was speeding off as I tooked it.
