### Name of taxi: J. Car Taxi

Meter is really fast. Distance to my home is 15-16km. The meter indicated it is 21km, which is impossible. I also notice the meter moving barely a few seconds several occasions indicating the driver might be pressing a button somewhere. Of course when I try to confront him about it, it's denied. I was charged 299.00 when my normal travel time with no traffic (this was around 12-1am) would be below 240 pesos. 

```Tampered or broken meter```
