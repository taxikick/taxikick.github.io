title: PWJ345 - Malate going to cubao
---

### Name of taxi: 

Taxi's meter is tampered. Manila going to cubao at midnight (when there's no traffic) costs 250 pesos. I saw him clicking something everytime the amount changes. There was one time that the amount changed twice within 10 seconds. I actually timed the change, and it changes only for about 15-20 seconds when it's supposed to change after 90 seconds. Greedy taxi driver!

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
