### Name of taxi: Tu...-Ilagan (cant recall the Tu... something part)

Very obvious batingting. It's my regular route on my way home. Eastwood to Riverbanks is just less than 4 km (around 3.1-3.3 something). But this taxi's meter showed 5.2 km. I confronted the old driver, his alibi is that he "weathered" the flood so baka "nasira yung metro" niya.

```Tampered or broken meter```
