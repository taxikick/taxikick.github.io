title: AXA8931 - Taoist Temple Cebu City to Temple of Leah
---

### Name of taxi: N/A

This taxi is a grab car. Plate # AXA 8931. Driver's name Edwin Asentista. We rode the said taxi from Toist Temple routing to Temple Leah here in Cebu. The estimated fare based on grab app was 150-250 max. When we rode the taxi we noticed the meter was already at 50.50 pesos. So we thought the meter was already tampered. A minute after, he told us we're going to pay an amount of 350 pesos fixed rate. He might thought we we're tourists. I eveb told him it's not gonna take 350 pesos to get to the destination and refused to travel going there and he even told us to cancel our booking while we were on board and just drop us near taxi bays.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
