### Name of taxi: 21/21 Vision Taxi

The taxi driver's name is Dominador. Old guy in his late 50s. Though the taxi is named 21/21 Vision, I also saw Trends Transportation written. So probably a franchise. 

Initially I told him to drop me off acacia lane Shaw Blvd. But it started raining and asked if he could enter A. Bonifacio street but he refused. So I told him to just drop me off at the corner of acacia and Shaw. Paid 150 and waited for my change when the meter hit 145. He got irritated and said he doesn't have change. And wanted to make a U-Turn to get change which will end up having me dropped off further from my intended location. When I wanted to get a picture of his plate number, he sped off hence I don't have the plate number to provide.
