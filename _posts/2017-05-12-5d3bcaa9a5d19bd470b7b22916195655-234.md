title: UVS561 - Kalayaan BGC flyover going to Buendia, Makati City
---

### Name of taxi: JERM Transport Service 

Around 8:05AM, while we were stuck in morning rush hour traffic on Kalayaan-BGC flyover going to Buendia, Makati City, this JERM Transport Service taxi (plate #UVS 561) tried to cut my right lane and intentionally tried to ram my left side mirror using his taxi's right side mirror! Fortunately I was able to warn the driver by honking my horn. He's so aggressive, even though I'm the first in the lane, he still cut me and blocked my path. And when the traffic flow began to move, he even intentionally stopped his taxi and didn't bother to move. Parang nang-aasar pa! Sya na nga ang nang-agaw ng lane at muntik pang makabangga sa akin, makapal pa ang mukhang mang-asar! And he even has the gall to give us a bad stare! This crazy, abusive and stupid taxi driver has no place in the streets and should be stripped of his drivers license. Walang pakialam ang taxi driver kahit meron syang pasahero, ganun pa din ang balahurang ugali nya.
