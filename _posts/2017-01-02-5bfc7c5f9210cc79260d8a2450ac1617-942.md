### Name of taxi: Boy Wonder

My dad and mom requested for a taxi going to Via Mare, Up Town Center. They told the taxi they wanted to be brought to QC. He was kinda OK with it until they asked to be driven to Via Mare, UP Town Center. At Magsaysay Ave., Diliman. He then claimed not to be familiar with the place. And it's in QC. Taxi drivers are supposed to know how to navigate around... he let my parents get off the taxi (they were already inside). He told them: "Buti kung alam niyo pupuntahan niyo... e Hindi rin naman... e di ko rin kabisado... o, pano yan?!"

The Rockwell security told us he probably knows the place and just acted dumb so he can refuse them as passengers...
