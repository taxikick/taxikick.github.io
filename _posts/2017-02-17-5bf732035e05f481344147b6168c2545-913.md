title: UWH716 - Kalentong area

### Name of taxi: Davis

When I boarded the taxi from Makati medical, I already told the taxi driver that my destination will be around P. Cruz area, Mandaluyong. He asked if it was in Boni area ( which means he knows the area) and I responded "yes". We took Kalentong route however after passing Kalentong driver drove all the way to- close to
Pasig river area and said that we'll just take Blumentritt-Coronado street area which is wayyyyy to far from
My destination. Obviously, the driver is trying to ago around in circles so I could pay him more. My usual fare from Makati is P100 but I paid around P160 because of the driver.

```Over charging, No receipt```
