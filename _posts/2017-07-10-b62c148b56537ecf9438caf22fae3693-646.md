### Name of taxi: Rvillegas taxi

My girlfriend rode the taxi at unionbank building when she noticed that the taxi meter is already reaching the expected amount and she is still halfway of her destination. Before that the driver is playing loud music in his car possibly so you will not notice the tampered meter. Upon reaching acacia lane along shaw blvd, my gf told the taxi driver that she will get off. To her surprise the driver even trying to bill 150 php even though the meter just mark 113!

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
