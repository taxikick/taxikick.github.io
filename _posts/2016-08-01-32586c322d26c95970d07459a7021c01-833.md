title: JXS988 - NAIA T1 to New World Manila Bay Hotel
---

### Name of taxi: Yellow Airport Taxi

Took a yellow  taxi from NAIA Terminal 1 to my condo building next to New  World Manila Bay Hotel in Malate. I take this route regularly and it is about 9.9miles according to Google Maps and about 220Php if driver/meter are honest. This time, the "receipt" read 25.391km for a trip that took 24 minutes. Where in Manila can you go 25.39km in 24 Minutes?! The bill was Php414! How does a 9.9km ride become 25.3km?

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
