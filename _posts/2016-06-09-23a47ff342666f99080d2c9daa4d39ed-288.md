title: UVH858 - BGC to tejeron
---

### Name of taxi: LEFC

I put my girlfriend to a taxi and he said yes to going to tejeron. While he was driving he knew my girlfriend was alone and told her to give her 40 pesos because he is a grab taxi, my girlfriend says no and he said if you dont give 40 pesos ill add 100 pesos. He then took my girlfriend to a high way when it is nowhere close to tejeron which made the meter go from 200 pesos instead of 120. His name is Elmo Torres Valenzuela.
