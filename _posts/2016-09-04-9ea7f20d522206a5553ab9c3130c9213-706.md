### Name of taxi: Ben-Beth Transport

I went inside his cab and he refused when I said the destination. So I left his door open because I was pissed off. We had verbal exchange but when I got to another taxi he went after us, opened my door area attempting to hit me with a tiring then he punched me on my mouth area and drove off.
