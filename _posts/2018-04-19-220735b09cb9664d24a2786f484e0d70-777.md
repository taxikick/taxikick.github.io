### Name of taxi: Unknown

After I entered and told the taxi driver where the destination is (Which is lower tomay thru ambiong road )and asking questions about the place, he realized it was far and answered it is traffic there and I said its not because it is not the highway and its an alternate route then the driver said, "Hindi ko pala alam un daan and malayo" and asked me to seek another taxi. After getting out, another passenger went inside and they drove off.
