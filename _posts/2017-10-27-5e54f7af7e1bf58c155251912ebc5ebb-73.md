### Name of taxi: N/A

Me and my work mate went home from work riding this taxi who does not want to use the meter. Which at first we did not notice and when we are getting off he insist on charging us 70 pesos which the fee should have been 50. And his reason is because it’s four of us riding. So i said “ok! Lets take a picture!” So i immediatly get off and took the picture and ran away. I saw the driver came out the car and realized that he cant find me anymore. And when i got home and realized that the plate is for private cars not for public transpo.

```Over charging, No meter```
