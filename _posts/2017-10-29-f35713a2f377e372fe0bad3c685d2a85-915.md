### Name of taxi: M.g.e

The driver was very rude. He is definitely one of the reasons why people choose not to take taxis. I was with my lola and we brought her wheel chair. The driver didnt even bother to help us take the wheel chair in or out his trunk. He was very impatient. He was also driving very fast. Lastly, he slammed the door when we got out of his cab. Worst cab ride ever.

```Rude behavior, Dirty seats & interiors```
