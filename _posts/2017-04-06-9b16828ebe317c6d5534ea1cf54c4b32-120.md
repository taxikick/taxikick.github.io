### Name of taxi: Elygin

Hi, I would like to complain a taxi with plate # TXZ 529. Taxi name is Elygin. Driver's name is Porferio Ladiao. Our security from Holiday Inn Manila Galleria queued for the said taxi going to Sto Tomas Pasig City from Ortigas. Taxi refused to take me and told me, "Bawal ako jan sa Pasig, odd even ako e." I responded, "Wala hong coding ng 1:00am, kuya." He replied, "Sige na ho bawala ako jan e." I told him that I would report him as there were police officers stationed in the hotel and he got scared and told me, "Sige sige, isasakay ko na kayo." I declined as I got scared that he might do something to me along the way. I have 2 witnesses, 2 security guards of Holiday Inn Manila Galleria. They actually suggested to have the driver reported to the police officers stationed in that area. Thank you.
