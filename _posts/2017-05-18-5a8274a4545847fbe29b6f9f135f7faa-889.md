### Name of taxi: May Reklamo

Taxi driver approached me at departure area and asked if I needed a taxi and said he is metered.  I said ok and got my luggage in and we left.  He quickly stated a rate that was not understood but he made a point of showing me he turned the meter on.  Upon arrival at hotel he states 1400 pesos.   I said that's way to much that I always pay between 250 to 325 every time I have taken this exact same route.  I notice there is black electricians tape covering a large portion of the meter readings and asked why the tape.  Driver told me that it's an airport taxi and an airport meter. I asked for a receipt and he refused to provide one.  I asked to see the written fare rates and he refused to show me.  He said over and over 200 pesos per kilometer and 7 kilometers so 1400 pesos.   I told him I have never paid over 300 and he kept saying 1400 so I paid the 1400 pesos.  I have pictures of the altered meter along with the picture of the driver and car itself.  I can email those if you need them.  The authority number on front windshield is 6836.   Thank you for your help.
