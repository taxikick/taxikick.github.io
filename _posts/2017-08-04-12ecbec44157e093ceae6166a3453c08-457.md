title: ACI2976 - from balara q.c to mindanao ave. quirino hi-way
---

### Name of taxi: Romarena Taxi

i am going to Mindanao Ave. Quirino Hi-way from pansol balara q.c. when the driver took a u-turn under the flyover going to luzon, instead going straight. we took commonwealth ave. to philcoa to eliptical road then visayas ave then mindanao ave cor. congresional ext then to my destination. I can accept the way he chose if it is bumper to bumper traffic, but its saturday and there's no traffic, I've been passing to luzon ave - congressional ext monday to friday and there is no hassle/ traffic unlike today he mad me look like a fool going around. my bill was 159.00 when it should be just 100.00 to 110.00. i am a regular taxi passenger but this one was abusive in terms of fooling his client taking a long way. please make him learn his lesson.
