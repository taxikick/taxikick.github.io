### Name of taxi: Unknown

The driver of this taxi agreed that our destination is kalayaan ave. Makati, near BGC. 
Then, near SM north he acted rude. He wanted us to get off of his taxi he is driving then pay the fare, we since we didnt have change to pay that. We went to caltex just to find a change. He started to spit provoking words coz we cant pay thr fare in the meter.
After we paid the fare, we asked the receipt. He again started to spit provoking words. He acted like he wants to punch my workmate.

```No receipt, Rude behavior```
