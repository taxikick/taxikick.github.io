### Name of taxi: DS CANANEA

I was headed to Export Bank- Pasong Tamo that night.

I asked the driver to put on his meter but he answered that i should pay P200 since it is the usual payment going to my destination. I answered him back that the place is near but he insisted that the road is congested/traffic. I insisted him to use the meter but he offerred me 2 options; to pay P200 or give an additional P50. 

I was already pissed the moment i entered the car since the barker already asked P50 for "tip". Then here comes the driver asking for P200 or add P50. Just wow.

I understand that we all need to earn a living but i am ALSO working hard to meet mine. Why were taxi meters installed in the first place if taxi drivers still ask for additional payments or make payment arrangements??!
