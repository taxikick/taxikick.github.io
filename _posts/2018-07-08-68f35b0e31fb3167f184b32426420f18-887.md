### Name of taxi: No sure

We got inside the cab and we told the driver that our destination is in La Salle and he told us that he is about to go home and he wants to take clients that are going near his home (he mentioned Tondo). So he refused us and we had no choice but to leave the car. The next passengers took the cab and we overheared that they want to go to MOA. The driver accepted despite the reason that he told us earlier.
