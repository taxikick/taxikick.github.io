### Name of taxi: Unknown

The taxi driver just opened the door on the passenger seat beside the driver and asked where would be our destination. When mentioned going to The Medical City Ortigas but refused to board me and my husband. The taxi driver just turned at the round about inside the UP Technohub and took another passenger. He thought we'll be approaching him again he moved his taxi and opened the door shouting at my husband f*uck you.

```Refused boarding```
