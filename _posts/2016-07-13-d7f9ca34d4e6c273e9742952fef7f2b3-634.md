### Name of taxi: M.G.E

This old dude is so rude. Asked me which way should I want, I said "get the fastest route I'm not familiar with this place" he replied with rudeness.

After paying he didn't even gave me the change after I asked for it. He also replied "sayang effort". He shouldn't be driving taxi. 

```Rude behavior, Not giving exact change```
