### Name of taxi: M.G.E.

I asked the driver to ride to accompany me and my friend, 2 locations, first is in gagalangin tondo manila , second is in abad santos mayhaligue, when were already near gagalangin(pritil) my friend said to the driver to accompany me to my house, the driver dont want, but we already said that the taxi will go to 2 different locations. The taxi driver said that he dont want to accompany me to my house, then i said that i will not pay the bill because he did not ride me home. The driver went berserk and tell me that he is a police and we shall go to precint. He even said bad words like (tangina), then my friend said that stop stop arguing, so we just stop the car in pritil and pay the bill
