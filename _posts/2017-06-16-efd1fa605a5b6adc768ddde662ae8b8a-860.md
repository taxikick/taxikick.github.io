### Name of taxi: Unknown

We took the cab in Makati(Urban Avenue), and the driver said because of traffic jam, so we have to pay 500 pesos, I haven't met this unreasonable price in any countries but because I have to go to the airport for the flight so negotiated 400 pesos.He didn't turn on the meter. when arrived at the airport, my brother tell to the driver you said it's traffic jam, but there is no car(actually it was no car on the road). However, this driver keeping saying pay 400, and say sometimg bad in Tagalog(I think it was bad words) we know this is unreasonable but it's foreign country, actually Filipino taxi drivers almost are rude and have no manner, and I am really wondering they are educated in Philippines because their English level is too low actually, and his word in Tagalog really made me uncomfortable 

```Over charging, No meter```
