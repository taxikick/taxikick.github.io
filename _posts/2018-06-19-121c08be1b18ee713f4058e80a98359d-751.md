### Name of taxi: Antonio Angeles Jr. Tondai Trans Inc

So, me and my colleague are going home persisted on taking a taxi instead due to grab high fare costs. I asked the driver if he is good for Vito Cruz as a destination and he agreed. Not a long after, he demanded a 50 php 'charity' for coffee or balut. On top of that, we asked that he should go to ayala route or jupiter route which takes us only about 150 php on average. But he insisted on going to Ortigas Manila to UN station up to the destination which he said was quicker. And so we agreed. After noticing something weird, this driver made us go circles that ended ua costing 225 php. Good thing I have an exact amount in me that this scam was further avoided
