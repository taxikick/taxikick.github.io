title: ATA4254 - Between NAIA and Ortigas
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown. (A yellow airport taxi, the red sticker was S-125)

- The taxi has absolutely no driver details inside.

- The meter was rigged, there is a turning switch below the meter which the driver can adjust the increase rates of the distance traveled and the time spent while the car is stationary.

- The driver immediately turned the switch to normal rates as soon as I asked him about the strangeness of the number on the meter, which has already been overcharged "A LOT".

- We could not get off the taxi as we took the express way from NAIA to Ortigas (not far from the Marco Polo Ortigas Hotel,).

- The final rate taxi charged us was 40+ minutes of waiting in stationary and 70+ kilometers of distance traveled, netting over 1000 pesos for the real distance of less than 15 kilometers.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
