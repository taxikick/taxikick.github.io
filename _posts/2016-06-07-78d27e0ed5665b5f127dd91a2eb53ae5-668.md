### Name of taxi: Alprekenn

I told the driver to take pagasa going to mindanao avenue but he never listened, he was even mad that I told him what way we will be going to that's why I decided to take another taxi because of how rude the driver is, when I was about to go down, he called me baboy and mareklamo. No wonder people choose grab and uber nowadays!

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
