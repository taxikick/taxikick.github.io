### Name of taxi: Unknown

We were in line for taxi with meter to get from terminal 4 to terminal 2. He said he was a taxi with meter. He told me to grab a metered taxi service slip. We noticed he never turned on the meter. We asked him again and he said it's a fixed rate due to traffic hours. He made us pay 650 pesos. It was supposed to be only 50-60 pesos. 

```No meter, No receipt```
