title: UYE290 - On the way to McKinley Hill from Edang Street cor. EDSA Pasay

### Name of taxi: CNC Express

Driver asked for a plus 50 so I said bababa na lang ako. It was only 5:50am so there was no traffic yet. Then he said, "Sige, kahit pang kape na lang." So I said na bababa pa rin ako. Then he said kahit wag na lang daw. Although in the end, he did not get the extra money he was asking for, I think cases like this should still be reported.

```Over charging```
