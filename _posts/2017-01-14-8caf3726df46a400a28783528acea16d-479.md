title: ARA7024 - Ever Supermarket , QC to Binondo
---

### Name of taxi: GMAT

Hi, I would like to report a GMAT taxi driver, plate no. ARA 7024 for fast meter. Our 40 minute ride today from Ever supermarket, Quezon City to Benavidez St. Binondo, Manila costed us 245php and there was only little traffic.

When we boarded this taxi, he requested us to add 50php to the meter fare since it's traffic. We refused, but he took us to Binondo anyway. What's surprising was, his meter incremented from 3php to 5php every minute. The whole trip took around 40 minutes and the total bill was a whopping 243php.  It even increased to 247 even the car was parked for a minute. We had to leave very quickly so we didnt get the chance to take pictures for evidence. We brought it up to the driver and he only said that the meter was 'newly calibrated' this morning.  It seems that he's had complaints about this in the past .

 I hope LTFRB can solve this growing problem.
