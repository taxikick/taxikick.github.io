### Name of taxi: GA-Dou

after I told him my destination he bluntly say bad luck wished I wasn't the passenger he is always on a hurry almost got into accident despite the rush hour 
repeating cursing in the air 
when I try to sleep he turned the radio so loud to make sure I won't sleep 

always puffing out sighing to the point he asked me to go out of taxi 
I cannot go out of course it's rush hour and I waited in line for taxi and its hard to get taxi that time 
when Its time to go out he shoo me away like im a free loader!!!
