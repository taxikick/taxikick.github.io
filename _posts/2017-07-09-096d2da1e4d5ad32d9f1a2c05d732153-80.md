title: ACD1382 - NAIA T3 Arrivals

### Name of taxi: Yellow Airport Taxi

I usually take Grab or Uber because taxi drivers are one of the most arrogant and discourteous people in the world. However, since the NAIA 3 Airport Taxi line is really short, I decided to go for it to get home asap. Upon my turn and knowing my destination is only in Domestic Road, the driver accused me of cutting the line and asked me to wait for my turn. I didn't actually cut the line since I just entered the line from the left side instead of the usual right.

During the journey, I noticed the taxi meter was going really fast (it reached Php 160!!!!) and called the driver's attention on it. He stopped the meter and asked me to just pay my usual fare and goes on complaining that my trip is a waste of his time and shouldn't have cut the line. He rambles about his high boundary requirement and how it takes 3 hours to get inside naia 3. 

And i'm reminded why i always take Uber/Grab ever since.
