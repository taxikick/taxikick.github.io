title: UVY282 - SM MOA to Leon Guinto

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Correction on UYA 282. It shouldve been UVY 282. My sister and I was told that the drivers meter was broken when we had already put our heavy groceries on the back of the car and were already seated. We believed him since the meter was off. He told us to just agree at a price we said yes, thinking that it would be reasonable.That was the second mistake we made. By the time we arrived at our destination he told us to pay for 350 just because of traffic and when we refused he started becoming aggressive. For fear of getting assaulted we paid him the fee. 

```Over charging, No meter```
