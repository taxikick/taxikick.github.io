title: VFT664 - Barangay Sambag 1 to Cebu IT Park
---

### Name of taxi: M&J Taxi

I was on my way to work at Cebu IT Park in Lahug, Cebu City. Since I only have 50min left before my shift starts, my best option is thru a cab. I rode the taxi w/ plate # VFT664 near USC South Campus around 6:15pm. When we got near P. del Rosario street, the driver asked which route shall we go, I immediately replied via Echavez Road. Instead, he went straight to Hipodromo St. When we approached near Gen. Maxilom Avenue(Mango Ave), he asked me again which way. I then replied GO left at Mango then right at Gorordo. Instead, he went straight again and I had to tell him you should go left to Cebu Business park because I'll be late once you take a longer route. He eventually turned left then went right to Bacalso Ave. This time we were caught in traffic and waited several minutes before we turned left thru Barangay Luz. I already prepared myself for whatever may happen. This driver might have done his thing many times. Obviously, he was able to charge me more than my usaual taxi fare.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
