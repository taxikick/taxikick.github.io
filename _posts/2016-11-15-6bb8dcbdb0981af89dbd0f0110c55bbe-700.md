### Name of taxi: Not MGE nor Dollar Taxi but it was a White Cab

He was driving real fast as-if we were racing and he was overtaking other vehicles along the way.We were like flying! It was one very scary ride of my life! We were about to hit the intersection and to top it off while he was making a turn going to Buendia Flyover he even accelerated instead of slowing down because he could've killed us and landed underpass of Buendia station. I hope u could address this concern.Im just thankful God didnt took away my life thats why im still here writing this report
