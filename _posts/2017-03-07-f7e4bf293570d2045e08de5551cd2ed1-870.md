### Name of taxi: Unknown

I honked at a taxi because he was in the middle lane and was blocking our path. Nothing is in front of the taxi and he was just looking for passengers. I highlighted at the taxi and this lead for the taxi shouting invectives at me and putting up a middle finger. When he moved and I was able to move forward, the taxi driver targeted me by trying to hit my car from the side. I didn't confront him but he kept bugging me for about 10 minutes. When he was in front of me he constantly stops immediately as he was trying for me to hit him from behind. But i have enough distance so it didn't happen. He kept on cursing along the way of macapagal boulevard until we separate ways in coastal road
