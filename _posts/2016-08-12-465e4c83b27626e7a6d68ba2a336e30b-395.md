title: UVR102 - Gilmore 
---

### Name of taxi: 

We rode at Gateway and I told him to bring us at Broadway Centrum and he agreed. He asked me where it was. I told him, I'm not sure but somewhere in Gilmore. When we were at Gilmore, he kept asking, "Gilmore na! San na kayo?" and I said Broadway Centrum and he kepts asking, rudely. I had to open my map app to find our destination. I TOLD it to him but it was so hard to give him directions. Then I just told him to bring us down at Broadway Avenue. He agreed. All of a sudden, when we reached the end of Gilmore, he just said, "Gilmore na dito na lang kayo. I was so upset and decided to just go down. The bill was 96php. I gave him 90php. He said, "kulang." I told him, "Diba minus 10". I was so surprised with his answer, "Di na uso yun." I was so afraid that he might do something to me or hurt me physically because his voice was already rising. I just added 6php and left the taxi. I swear, this driver shouldn't be in the streets. He is abusive and very rude! I forgot the name of the taxi but I hope he gets reprimanded or suspended!
