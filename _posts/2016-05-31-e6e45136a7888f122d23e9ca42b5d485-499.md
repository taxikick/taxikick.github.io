title: UWH989 - Intersection of Rosario Wet Market, Rosario Pasig City
---

### Name of taxi: 

We were on our way home to Antipolo when suddenly a white old model vios with plate number UWH 989 hit the passenger door side of the UV Express van were riding. The taxi's side mirror was folded due to the collision but the taxi driver refused to stop to make arrangements to our van driver. Instead, said taxi driver went right to Rosario Wet Market and didnt managed to pull over. Our driver went out of the van and run after the taxi and apparently per our driver's statement, he was able to meet the taxi driver because he was caught on a traffic. While there was a commotion between our van driver and the taxi driver, our driver pleaded for them to talk regarding the van's damage but the taxi driver refused to cooperate, sped up his taxi and our driver fell to the ground. He managed to ask permission for a motorcycle passerby to help him chase the taxi driver but was unsuccessful (These statements came from our driver as he relayed to us the incident that happened when he got out of the van). He wasnt able to get the picture of the car for he left his mobile phone inside the van but he managed to get the plate number and the car model which was a white old vios car. He wanted to ask for help because there was a damage to the van he was driving. It got scratches on the right passenger door side.
