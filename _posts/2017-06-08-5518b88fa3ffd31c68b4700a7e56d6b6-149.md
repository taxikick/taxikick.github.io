### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was already about 100 meters from home when the driver suddenly stopped the taxi, turned off the radio, and said, "Mang-iinsulto kan sa met." (Nang-aasar ka naman ata.) I was shocked and scared because the driver seems angry out of nowhere. He then said, "Kitam nga music ko daytoy, ipigsa-pigsam. Kasla kayang-kayam ti tao." (Tingnan mong music ko, nilalakasan mo. Parang kayang-kaya mo ang tao ah.) That is when I realized he was angry because I was whistling together with the music his playing so I started to apologize and explain myself,"Pasensyan ah manong haan ko met inggagara." (Pasensya na di manong hindi ko naman sinasadya) But he was still pissed-off for no apparent reason. I tried to apologize and level with the man but to no avail. It's as if he wants to pick up a fight with me to resolve the matter. I was very apologetic until we reached my drop-off yet he can't keep to be civil on his part simply because I ruined his music by whistling.Before I went down the taxi,the only thing I can memorize was the plate number detail. After I went down, I took another glance at the taxi and saw that his plate number was removed. I tried to rationalize the situation and thought to myself that that maybe was the reason he was not in the mood. But still, I feel harassed and helpless after the situation even though I paid my fairly paid my fare and have no fault.
