### Name of taxi: Unknown

Sumakay yung gf ko sa may MRT avenue, Taguig. Sabi nung driver mag add daw siya ng 30 pesos dahil mahal na daw gas. My girlfriend told me that the driver keep on asking her personal questions, "Miss may boyfriend ka ba? asawa o anak" "Buti naman miss wala ka pang asawa, napakaswerte ng mapapangasawa mo" here are sample questions that he keep on asking to my girlfriend during the ride. Hanggang pagbaba the driver keep on insisting, "Miss mukhang uulan hintayin ko na kayo" my gf keep on telling him that shes okay and there's no need for the driver to wait for her. Those questions are unnecessary and she felt uneasy. Hoping for your response and action. Thank you!
