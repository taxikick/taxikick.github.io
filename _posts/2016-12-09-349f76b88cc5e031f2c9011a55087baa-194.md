### Name of taxi: Lucky Philip

At around 11pm, taxi stopped in front of The Enterprise Center in Makati. We hopped in and initially asked to drop off in Timog but he refused saying he has to return the taxi at 12mn. We asked if he can drop us off in Boni and so he agreed. I noticed that he doesn't have an ID in front of the taxi he has no identity. His taxi meter was also defective. I just didn't want to cause a scene because it was already late. Pls take some action. He even said he can only drive up to BGC. The meter from Enterprise to Robinsons Pioneer was more than 115php
