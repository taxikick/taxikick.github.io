### Name of taxi: face

 The taxi officer at the airport's taxi stand said that the taxi will be metered BUT when I started the rides and asked the driver to turn ON the meter but he refused while the vehicle run away very fast leave the taxi stand and said it will be more cheaper using his own fare for PHP 1,600,- and he also intimidate that it will be safer if using his fare. No choice then pay his "price" after reach the destination.

```Over charging, No meter```
