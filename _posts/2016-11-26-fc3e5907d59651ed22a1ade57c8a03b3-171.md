title: PWJ345 - Makati to Ortigas Center
---

### Name of taxi: Dollar Taxi

Taxi’s meter is tampered. Makati going to Ortigas at midnight (when there’s no traffic) costs 260 pesos. I saw him clicking something everytime the amount changes.
My friend took another car, the same place, the same time ，cost 130 peso.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
