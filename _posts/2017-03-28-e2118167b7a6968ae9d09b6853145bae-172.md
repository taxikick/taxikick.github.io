### Name of taxi: Unknown

Just waiting for taxi in front of the grocery store. Then the taxi came. The lady ahead of us got the taxi first, but she didn't take it. So, we tried also. When we told the driver the place to go, he contracted a 100-Peso fare. Since we always ride taxi going home, we know that the meter will cost us only 60-70 pesos. So we declined.
He said that there will be no passengers for him to pick up within the destination area that's why he's contracting. Well, there's plenty of people there, and besides, the area is near.
So I said that, "Kuya, 60 nga lang pag metro pero sayo 100 gusto mo"
Then he just flared and yelled "Edi humanap kayo ng iba! Wala nga kong makukuha dun eh" And mumbled more as he passes by. 

Drivers like these should be apprehended. To lose their taxi permit.

```Over charging, No meter```
