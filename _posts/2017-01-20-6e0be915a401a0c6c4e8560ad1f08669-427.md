### Name of taxi: Unknown

My husband rode this cab going to work. His meter read 75 pesos so he only paid 70 pesos. The cab driver insisted that he lacks 5 pesos but my husband stood by the 10 peso deduction. The cab driver started shouting at him. This driver should be reprimanded! 

```Verbal harassment```
