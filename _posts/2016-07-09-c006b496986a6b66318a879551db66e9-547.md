### Name of taxi: Taxi

Taxi agreed to use the meter going to NAIA Terminal 1, however during the ride I noticed he covered the meter with a towel. Then when I asked for a receipt, he said something like "I hit reset just when I was supposed to print it". Really? He charged me 300PHP instead of my usual 160PHP ride to NAIA Terminal 1. 

```Over charging, Contracting```
