### Name of taxi: Unknown

The taxi was initially told that the drop off was in Makati. When the driver saw the heavy traffic going to Makati, he immediately asked me to alight and asked to transfer to another taxi. While refusing to pay, the driver raised his voice and was asking for payment and telling me "wala kang pera". Fearing because the driver is already shouting, I handed a P100.00. When the driver heard that I gave his plate number on the person I was talking to on the phone that time he immediately returned P50.00 and drove off.
