title: UVX855 - Q.AVE ROOSEVELT TO ROCES
---

### Name of taxi: I WASNT ABLE TO GET IT :(

He cut us off in Roosevelt, and when I honked at him he sped up and cut off more cars. He almost had a collision with the cars he cut off including ours. This guy is going to injure someone one day, or worse kill someone.
