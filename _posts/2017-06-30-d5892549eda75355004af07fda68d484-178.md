### Name of taxi: All types parked

We just got off a bus traveling from Bicol, it was 5 am.  There was a row of white taxes, parked, no drivers inside.  One approached us and asked if we need a taxi, and we said yes.  He then asked where and we told him.  He said 300.00.  My mom said, why are you doing that? It's illegal to do that now.  He replies oh ma'am it's because I don't know the location very well so I will have to look for it.  My mom said no, that's too expensive.  None of the other taxi drivers made any effort to help us, there was about 6 of them.  So they wouldn't help us unles we paid 300.  So we left, then we flagged down another taxi and he wanted to charge us 200! I said NO! Waited a few more minutes and finally found an honest taxi driver!  It only cost 88.00!  But we paid 200, because we believe in being honest an if anyone deserved it he did!

```Over charging, No meter```
