### Name of taxi: Don't know

Refused to convey me to my destination which was less than 2km away (Emerald to Gold Loop) because of the "traffic". This was 2:00pm, no traffic yet. And he did this when we've already traveled a couple hundred meters. He dropped me off in the middle of the road. Rude and unprofessional!
