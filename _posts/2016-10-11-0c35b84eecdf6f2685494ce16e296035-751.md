### Name of taxi: Mahk Transport Taxi

Hailed a taxi near Wackwack to go to Tiendesitas. Driver asked for an additional P50 because he said there was heavy traffic in that area. I agreed because I didn't want to be late for work. We got to Tiendesitas and the traffic was moderate to light.

```Over charging, Contracting```
