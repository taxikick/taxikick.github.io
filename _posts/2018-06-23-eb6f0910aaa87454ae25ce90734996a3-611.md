### Name of taxi: DIVINE INSPIRATION

The driver went outside his cab and went to us to have some contract. He asked how much do we normally add to the fair meter because we have some baggage. I said that we do not pay additionally because that is prohibited according to LTFRB. Then the driver laugh and said "Bawal ba yun? Walang bawal dun ngayon." Ugh. Then he refused to board us because we don't want to add any extra charges. That makes me triggered so I took pictures of the plate number. I guess the driver saw me taking some pictures, so he took a picture of me too while waiting for a Grab. Then one of his colleagues stood beside me while the driver's taking the pictures. Drivers like that must be taken off the licenses.

```Refused boarding, Contracting```
