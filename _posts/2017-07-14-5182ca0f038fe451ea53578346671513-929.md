### Name of taxi: J Dela Cruz

On july 12, 2017. when our guests rode a taxi with plate # UVZ 800, taxi name J. Dela Cruz, from Fisher Mall to Ace Condo, Banawe St., Quezon City, the taxi failed to bring my guests to the right address, instead the driver brought them to somewhere in Banawe.

When being questioned on why the driver brought them to the other place, the driver responded them arrogantly at the driver shouted and cursed them.

When my guests told the driver "don't shout & curse us because you don't know who we are the driver responded by saying "WALA AKONG PAKI-ALAM KONG SINO MAN KAYO, buamaba kayo sa taxi ko". Then, our guests disembarked the said taxi and rode another taxi going to their right location.

Trusting this arrogant driver will be subjected to disciplinary action by your office.

Thank you.
