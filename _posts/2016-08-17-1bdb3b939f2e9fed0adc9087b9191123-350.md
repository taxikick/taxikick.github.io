### Name of taxi: Jack Transport

I ride the taxi along Pandacan Manila and before I ride it I have asked if he has a receipt and he said Yes. Along the way he even said that I am working a long way from home but fortunately I can reimburse my Taxi expenses. I said yes as long as I can present a receipt. 
When we reached my destination (Eastwood), he even pretend not seeing the button on where he can print receipt, I even asked him to not press on the HIRE button as it will reset the meter but still he insisted  and "HELLO" appeared. Then he claimed that he ran out of paper for the receipt and he doesn't know it. When I told him that you even told me that you have a receipt before I board your taxi and now you are telling me that you cannot print any receipt?! He was speechless when I told him that he should not deceived people like that. He is well aware that he does not have any receipt in the first place but he cheated me so I will ride on his Taxi. 
I have given him P200 for the fare of P162.50, he have given me P40 for the change and asked additional P10 as he said that the fare was P167.50. I told him that it was just P162.50. He did not provided me the rollback fare of P10. 

```No receipt, Rude behavior```
