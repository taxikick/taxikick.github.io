### Name of taxi: KA-VALLONIWYLLSIAM

Me and my family are currently around 5th Avenue East and it's kind of traffic. We were inside our car and currently waiting for the traffic to move then this taxi infront of us constantly moved back despite my father beeping unto him. Then what happened next is our car plate got hit and had scratches. Moreover, when we checked the driver's license of the taxi driver, it's already expired because it's only valid til 05/13/2016 which was last May 13.
