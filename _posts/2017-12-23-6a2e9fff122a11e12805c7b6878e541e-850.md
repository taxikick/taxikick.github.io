### Name of taxi: Unknown

At first, he noticed that we are not Filipinos and tried to fool us with an existing meter. He did not reset it, so we told him to do so. And after, we noticed that the meter increased way too fast. I tried to measure the time, and it just took 2 seconds to increase again for 7 pesos. When we were going to moa, it just took 75 pesos but while riding home, we had to pay 130 pesos. We tried to ask him during the ride regarding the meter, but he pretended that he can’t hear well because he’s old. I really felt bad, especially today because I heard that many issues are occuring regarding stealing and overcharging because it’s Christmas. Why do we have to pay more or get things stolen because it’s holiday? :(((

```Over charging```
