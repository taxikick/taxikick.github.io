### Name of taxi: MGE

Offered trip from Greenbelt 5 to City Garden makati for 200p. I said "meter + tip" he agreed and he started driving. After about 100 meters he switched off the meter while driving, became aggressive and asked for 100p fixed rate. Had no option but to pay since taxi was moving 

```Over charging, No meter```
