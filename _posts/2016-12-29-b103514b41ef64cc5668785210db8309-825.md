title: UVU885 - Sm fairview

### Name of taxi: Mommy grace

The driver was contracting us to pay him 50php more on top of the metered rate in front of sm fairview because he said that he is not usually passing there even though we told him it was just 20 minutes away. 
Aside from us he also rejected another passenger that we saw in the same spot we flagged him down. Please take an action on this, this is not supposed to be an action of a taxi cab driver.
