title: UWL382 - Heritage Hotel by Baclaran to FiveStar terminal
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Driver did not turn his meter on and asked for 200 pesos for a 7-10 minute drive from Baclaran near Heritage Hotel to Five Star Bus terminal. We refused to pay and he acted rude saying that it was night that's why the charge was 200. He added that it was our fault for just stepping inside the taxi and not asking him first of the price. I ended up paying a 100, which I think is so overpriced. 

```Over charging, No meter```
