### Name of taxi: RAN GEN

The driver insists to let me and my friends to pay 50 per head or pay 200 from G. Puyat (LRT Buendia), Manila to E-com SM MOA Complex, Pasay. which is basically over priced and an illegal direct contracting. He said the jeepney barkers will be mad at him if he won't do per head. so I rebutted asking him if LTFRB allows contracting, if his operators are the barkers and what is the purpose of his meter. Then he threatened us to just go out of the cab. So I replied we will go out as long as it is fine for him if I will report him to LTFRB. Then he said he won't ask for a 200 pay anymore and he will drop us MOA without any fare as long as I will not report to LTFRB. We agreed and I just kept silent for the whole 9 minutes even if he still keeps on saying that he already made a favor to us as his passengers, barkers will be mad at him and "baka magreklamo pa kayo eh". then we arrived in MOA safely but insulted by the driver that he will just throw our money if we will pay.
