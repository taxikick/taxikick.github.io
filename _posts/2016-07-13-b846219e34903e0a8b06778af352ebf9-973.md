title: TPW777 - Bicutan Taguig City

### Name of taxi: M.G.E

He gave us a total bill of 1200Php from Airport Terminal 3 to Bicutan. He supposed to drop us in DOST but he dropped us somewhere that we don't even know the place. Since we don't have enough money we paid him 600Php because he is already mad and it seems that we really don't have any option because we really need to get home. Aside from that, we paid the toll gate for about 80Php.

```Over charging```
