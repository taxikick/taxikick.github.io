### Name of taxi: Unknown

While my friend and I are walking (we were actually on the rightmost side of the road), the taxi driver beeped on us. So, we looked at it first, them moved a little since there is no more spacefor us to move in. But, the taxi continued to drive and he was still able to bump my left arm. He didn't even bother to stop and at least apologize. In the first place, we are on the right and proper side. As for him, he can make adjustments by moving a little bit bit on the other sidebut he didn't.
