### Name of taxi: Sheperds Taxi

My meter indicated 127.50 pesos when i arrive at my destination, since I know that the 30 pesos flag down rate is still in effect, I payed 120 pesos. He still asked for the 7.50, since the flag down rate has been reverted back to 40 pesos "matagal na" daw.. 

```Over charging```
