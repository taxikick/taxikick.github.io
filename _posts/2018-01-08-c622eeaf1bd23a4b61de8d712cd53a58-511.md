### Name of taxi: Forgot

It's about 12mn and I took a taxi in P. Noval. Before I got in the taxi I told the driver where I was going and he agreed to drive me there. I was already near my place when I noticed that the meter is turned off. When we arrived I gave him a hundred peso bill and waited for my change(whenever I ride the taxi, my bill is only ranging from 60-80 pesos, that's why I know I should have a change). But he said "150 sana," kamot ulo pa then whispered "hayaan na nga." I asked him to give me my change but he said that he contracted me to give him 150, in which I didn't agree, I didn't even hear him say that in the first place. I checked grab and the fee for my trip is only 70 pesos. For pete's sake, I'm only 1.2kms and I'm a student. That's still 30 pesos I can use for my next ride! But, what I don't like the most about this trip is that when I asked him nicely and told him that I didn't agree on that he still insisted that I give him the payment and became rude as we talk. That's why I just let him take the 100 pesos. I don't wanna make a scene cause I think he's ready to do so.
