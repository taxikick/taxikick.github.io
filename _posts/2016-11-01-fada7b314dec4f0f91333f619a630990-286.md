### Name of taxi: MRARDS

Upon pickup i noticed the meter read 40 pesos... While driving  he intentionally covered the meter so that i couldn't read it. Upon arrival to the airport i had to repeatedly point to the covered meter and ask what what does it read? He reluctantly remover the cover and showed me. He doesn't deserve a tip but i have him a small one any way 

```Tampered or broken meter```
