### Name of taxi: White tax from NAIA Taxi Stand

Decided to take a white taxi from the official NAIA taxi 1 line. Just sat in taxi and already he drove off. Asked the driver to turn on meter and told me there was no meter. When I looked there was really none or might be hiding somewhere. He handed me a sheet of prices around Manila, which are at least twice the meter rate. The prices on that sheet were outrageous that I had to negotiate and he was still asking for more. Beware: the white taxi line is new at NAIA 1 and some of them are corrupt. I've used taxis from the same line and were honest.

```Over charging, No meter```
