### Name of taxi: Federal Taxi

I was crossing the street when I saw him coming but he was still far from me about 3 cars away instead of slowing down he sped up and side sweep the back part of my leg, although I did not get hurt,  I still almost got hit and when I got angry and confronted him he even laughed, so I got more angry but he did not get out of the taxi but instead made a dirty finger.  He probably is on drugs. I hope he gets caught. This happened around 8:15 AM September 08, 2016
