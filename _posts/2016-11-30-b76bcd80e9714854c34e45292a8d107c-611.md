### Name of taxi: CTC cebu 

we told the driver that our destination will be in abellana sports complex cebu and that we have two friends that will be drop off at redemptorist church. Upon arriving at redemptorist he said he'll be charging 40 pesos because of it and we asked him why but he didnt answer us and told us to just vacate ASAP because we didnt agree with the amount that he is charging us. We then vacated the cab but as we walk along the road he lowered his window and starts pointing finger at me and then tried to assault me. We didnt get his full name because he didnt hung his driver's id. This happened at around 3:30 in the afternoon. 

```Rude behavior, Out of line```
