### Name of taxi: KEN Taxi

I noticed there is a fast ticking sound at first I ignored it but when I look at it and observe it is faster than the usual. I also know my meter charge everytime I take taxi going to work and we even took a shortcut. He also drives slowly that is why it ads up to the amount that I should not pay for then I just asked him to drop me of before my meter went super high luckily I always send the taxi name and plate number to my family. I also noticed his hands are always under the meter when I start looking at it he then removes his hands

```Tampered or broken meter```
