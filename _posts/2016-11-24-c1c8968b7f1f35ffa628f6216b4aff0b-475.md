### Name of taxi: Unknown

We my mom, a senior citizen and my younger sister who happens to be a PWD (autistism) bound to shaw boulevard 2go specifically. We bought stuff to be sent to the province. I asked Mr Driver the location. 
When he knew it. He asked how much will I pay? Then I replied, will just use taxi meter. He declined. And offered him will add P50. But still he refused. 

```Refused boarding```
