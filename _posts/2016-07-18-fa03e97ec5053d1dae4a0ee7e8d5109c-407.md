### Name of taxi: 

My sister boarded a taxi in SM North. Along west ave, the driver was feeling sleepy and he always stops at corners. When she noticed that the driver was driving faster and felt sleepy.  Along the underpass in araneta ave., they were speeding really fast that my sister was frigthened. She decided to be dropped along welcome rotonda. When she's about to go down, the driver said, "Takot ka ba, miss?"
