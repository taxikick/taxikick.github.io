### Name of taxi: I Forgot something G or J

I was in Terminal 1 and decided to get a Taxi.
He leds me somewhere Instead of where I am supposed to go.
And he decided to stop the car in front of COD because he wanted me to sit beside him(I was at the back) so thatâ€™s my chance to freed myself from whatever he will do to me. I was able to get out of the taxi and I walked fast but then he was so persistent to let me in.
