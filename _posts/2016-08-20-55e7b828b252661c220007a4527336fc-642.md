### Name of taxi: N?A

I boarded this cab from Ayala Terraces Fairview on 08/20/2016 at about 9pm going to Jordan Plains subd. This driver refused to turn on his metro and requested us to pay 200PHP. we insisted he uses his metro but he refused and decided he wont go with us anymore. Not even considering the fact that it was raining, I find that inappropriate for the a cab driver to behave this way.

```Refused boarding, No meter```
