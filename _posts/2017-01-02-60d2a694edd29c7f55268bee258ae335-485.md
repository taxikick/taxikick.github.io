### Name of taxi: Unknown

At 7:50 p.m. on Monday, Jan 2, we took a taxi from The Beacon to Greenbelt 5. I am 75 years old, PWD, and walk with a cane. My wife boarded in the front passenger seat, our daughter in the rear, and as I was getting in I told the driver, "I'm not in yet. Please wait." The driver started pulling away when I still had one foot on the ground and one in the cab. I screamed. He stopped. Had the door struck a lamp post or railing, my foot would have been amputated. Not one word of apology. Then he raced us to Greenbelt 5 at breakneck speed. In twelve years of coming to Manila for several weeks just about every year, and owning properties here, we ride taxis often. I have never had a more breakneck ride. This driver is a hazard to passengers.
