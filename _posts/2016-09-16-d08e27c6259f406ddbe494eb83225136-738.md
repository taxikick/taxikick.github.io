### Name of taxi: Airland

â€‹Good day. This happened September 17, 2016 around 1am. Taxi driver asked for extra 50 pesos because of our location. First, why he did not tell us when we got in the car and waited for the time that we can not go out anymore. Second, he should have asked politely and not sounding arrogant and angry, because in the first place, we are not obliged to pay him, IT IS AGAINST THE LAW. When we paid, he did not say anything and looking so angry rather. What a kind of driver he is. I am looking forward for a response as I am really disappointed. He should have waited for us to pay him extra, as we always do, not ask for it arrogantly.
