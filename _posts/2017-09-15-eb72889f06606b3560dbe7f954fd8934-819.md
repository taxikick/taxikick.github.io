### Name of taxi: humble beginnings

There is a make shift taxi bay infront of All Home with barkers, problem is if they know the taxi driver:
1) Taxi drivers are automatically collecting 100 pesos per passenger from All Home to McKinley only. Without traffic today, it should have only cost 80 pesos max. This happened few times before and today.
2) They get multiple passengers if that's in the same area. I shared the taxi with someone who will be dropping to 3 World Square which is near our office. Sharing is okay (if the charge was split) but the driver collected 100 pesos each. 

The driver was polite but it is looks like this has been his practice all this time.
