#### Taxi name: Dollar Taxi

I got in on SM Aura and asked to be dropped off to our village which amounted the trip to 103.00. I paid for 95php since I know it should be flag down rate na, the driver called me and said, "Ma'am, hindi na po flag down. Binalik na po sa 40php" Sabi ko,"Ano? Kelan pa?" Sagot ng driver,"Hindi pa po kasi naipapasa." 

So dahil pagod na din ako and I wanna go inside na, binigyan ko na ng 5php yung driver since 5php lang din naman hiningi niya. Pagkapasok ko ng gate at pagikot niya pabalik sumigaw siya ng,"Kuripot!" Rude lang, kasi if he wanted a tip he could have just asked for it, not lie and kung ano pa sasabihin niya. Everyone works hard for money.
