title: POZ683 - From Riverbanks to Mercedes Village, Pasig City
---

### Name of taxi: Joannian taxi

We hailed a cab at riverbanks, but I noticed that the driver asked too many questions before letting us go inside his cab. I told my brother to find another ride instead, but before I hail another cab behind him, the driver already let us in. However, upon entering our village's gate, he was already complaining that our place was too far and drove really fast and was murmuring words that made us all upset. When we finally reached the house, my brother gave him 500pesos and waited for the change. The meter only shows 163pesos. but the driver only gave him 300pesos and kept on complaining that the 37pesos was still not enough. We have no problem in giving tips especially to cab drivers, but due to unsatisfied service, reckless driving and rude behavior; plus he was the one who dictated the fare price, we were really mad. He almost caused us trauma because of the way he drove and his very rude behavior.  I hope he can at least undergo a seminar or suspension.
