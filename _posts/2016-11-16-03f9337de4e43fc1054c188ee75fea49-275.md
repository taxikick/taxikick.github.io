### Name of taxi: St. Andrews

From Matandang Balara - E. Todriguez cor. Hemady, my cab fare ranges from 150-165 given the usual traffic. I usually travel around 830-900 am. Today, nmy cab fare amounted to 192 pesos. As I was about to arrive in my location, I noticed that my fare was already 178 and I was still like 800 meters away from my destination. Turns out, the seconds on the fare meter was running way too fast. 
Upon arriving, I told the driver that the fare was unusually high and he was just mum about it. I know it's just a 30-peso difference but the crazy meter was uncalled for.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
