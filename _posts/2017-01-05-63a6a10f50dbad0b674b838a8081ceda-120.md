### Name of taxi: Wasn't noted

We were next in line at the taxi stand so we can go home. I was with my husband, sister, aunt and my 5-year old kid. The taxi driver let us board his taxi, all 5 of us. But, then he suddenly said that we already exceeded the maximum passenger capacity which is 4 (with dismay on his face). We told him that the 5th person is just a kid, a 5-year old at that. He insisted that my kid is already counted as a 5th passenger. Technically, yes, he is the 5th passenger. But as far as I know, the capacity is 4 ADULT passengers (his taxi was a Toyota Vios-not the latest model though), so I don't see where we'll be violating anything. Then he suggested that we take 2 taxis (I didn't have a good look on the next taxi in line if it was someone from the same taxi company, maybe it was a modus). Since we know that it was too much for us to travel with 2 taxis, we decided to leave and get another taxi instead. When we told him that we'll be getting off his taxi, he rudely said and still insisted that he will not be taking as anywhere. I don't see why he still said that when we've already decided to get off. To my frustration I said to him, "I know, we're not forcing you to do so."
