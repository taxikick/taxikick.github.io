### Name of taxi: CANT RECALL

WAS GOING HOME FROM MALLING AND GOT REFUSED BY CAB DRIVER SO WENT TO THE NEXT ONE TOLD THEM THE LOCATION (LRT-BUENDIA, GIL PUYAT only) SO THE DRIVER TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO PAY HIM P250 BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY TRAFFIC. HOWEVER, I INSISTED TO USE THE METER AND SO THEREAFTER, HE REFUSED TO BOARD US.

```Refused boarding, Contracting```
