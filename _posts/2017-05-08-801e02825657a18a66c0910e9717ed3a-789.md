### Name of taxi: Miraby taxi

I ride the taxi from fairview terreces to bistekville 2 which is about 5-7mins drive. I'm always riding a taxi almost everyday and it will only cost me aroung 61-70 pesos. However today there is no traffic and I notice that the meter is increasing too fast and in just lest done a minute. I was asking the driver why but he is pretending that he cannot hear me. The fair that I had is 85.50. 

```Tampered or broken meter```
