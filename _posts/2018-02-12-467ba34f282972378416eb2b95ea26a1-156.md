### Name of taxi: Unknown

We rode a taxi from San Joaquin Pasig to North Signal Village. The driver asked for additional Php 20 because of the traffic. Our taxi metered is Php 155.00. I gave him Php 200. I was expecting for Php 20.00 change since he asks for additional Php 20.00 but he only gave me Php 10.00 with a rude behavior.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
