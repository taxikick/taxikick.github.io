### Name of taxi: taxi

The trip was supposed to be very short less than 300 m.
We decided to hail a cab bexause me and my were carrying a freshly brought bed frame. 
We were telling the cab that its just a short trip but he refused rudely and even revved the engine in front of us leaving us in a smoke trail.
