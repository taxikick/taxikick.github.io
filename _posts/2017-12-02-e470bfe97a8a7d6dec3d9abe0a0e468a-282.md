### Name of taxi: Bea & San taxi

From lifestyle district to xavier heights usually costs 150 and the driver said that I need to pay extra because there’s not much passenger at uptown. I was shocked and agreed because I don’t know what to say. And I said that i only have 200pesos and he said that maybe that’s okay. And I didn’t said a word. While he was driving he insisted to turn off the meter so that I will have to pay my 200pesos. But i refused to turn it off, the meter was 145pesos but he still managed to get my 200pesos cash i had.

```Over charging```
