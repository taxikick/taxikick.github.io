### Name of taxi: Stealth Trans Inc.

Driver was rude, impatient. Instead of words, his complaint about being stuck in the usual traffic inside the Green Hills shopping center was through rude grunts, sighs, and tsk-tsks. If he could possibly eject us, he would have done it immediately. He even instructed us to just walk through the mall to get to where we wanted to go. The nerve of this guy!!! We hired him to take us to where we had to go, not to be instructed to walk!

```Rude behavior```
