### Name of taxi: 

The driver refused to let us in his taxi right when we told him our destination, it seems that taxi drivers in this area (in front of Megamall B) are only accepting passengers whose destinations are convenient for them to go to. (Yes I am copy-pasting because it happened many times in the same area on the same night. I am about to report 7 drivers today)
