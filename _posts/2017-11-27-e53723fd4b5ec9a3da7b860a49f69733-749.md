### Name of taxi: unknown white taxi

It was around 6 pm(sunday). My mother who is a senior citizen and i had been waiting for taxi for more than 30 minutes already when manong driver arrived. He stopped for us but when he learned that our destination is intersection of mindanao ave and tandang sora, he immediately said, we have to pay addl 30 on top of the regular meter. I know 30 is not a big amount i dont want to tolerate this kind of behavior. I did not argue with the driver but refused to ride. Luckily we are able to get a taxi few minutes after.
i hope auhorities can do something to properly regulate taxis here in metro.

```Over charging```
