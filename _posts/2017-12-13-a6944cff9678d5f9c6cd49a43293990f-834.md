### Name of taxi: Purple

The driver refuses to take in a ride since he mentioned that he has someone already that he would pick up and is out of the way from where I am going which is BGC. He already refused another passenger ealier near me. He got angry when I attempted to take a picture of his cab went on hysterical saying that he did not do anything wrong.
