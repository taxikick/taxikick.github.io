title: AAF9214 - Davao city (route damosa to lanang executive homes)
---

### Name of taxi: Red dragon

Route was only damosa to lanang executive homes, and I usually walk home. Today, it was raining and i have a lot of baggage so i decided to ride a taxi. The fare was just 54 pesos on the meter so i asked him how much. Normally, every davao taxi driver would give less php10 due to the mandate but he said it was 54. I just gave in and gave him 55 but he then said that he wanted an additional amount because its christmas. Exact words "panghatag nlng ug pahalipay sa pasko maam". That's when i snapped. He didn't give me the right change, he even had the nerve to ask for more when my taxi ride was just less than 5 mins!!! I told him that this is davao and he should not be doing this because it can ruin the reputation of the city but he didn't listen. 

```Not giving exact change```
