### Name of taxi: RAN-GEN

I rode a taxi this 11:30pm but was unable to retrieve the driver's name since his id was facing towards the front mirror. This driver accepted the transaction to drop me in malibay edsa only, but in the middle of the ride, the driver suddenly told me to get off because there is a heavy traffic on my way home. As a passenger, it is very rude of him to just drop me in a place that I am quite unfamiliar where Other modes of transportation are not known to me just because of that petty reason. He should have rejected me in the first place and not accepted the transaction instead of Dropping me off because there is a heavy traffic on the way. In my mind, i rode a taxi so that I can go home safely at night where I have ended my shift. Maybe that's why people shift to uber or grab car because most of the taxi drivers are really rude to their customers and sometimes just think of the money instead of  doing their jobs well. I hope that this driver should be reiterated on the values, morals, and rules and regulations on the job that he has entered himself to. If he does not like his job, then look for another, do not risk the safety of your passenger for the convenience of the driver. 

```Rude behavior```
