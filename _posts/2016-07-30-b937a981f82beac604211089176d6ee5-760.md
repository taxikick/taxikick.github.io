### Name of taxi: 

I am the cousin of the the passengers who happened to be foreigners and  are just taking a vacation in this place. These people  took a taxi until they reached their destination. They paid for the taxi fare accordingly, as what was shown in the taxi meter
but the taxi driver asked for more money. He said, "Pay me more!". The passengers were just so disappointed with this kind of act and attitude from the driver. 


```Over charging```
