title: UWH590 - The Medical City Going to Sta. Mesa V.Mapa Route Via San Juan
---

### Name of taxi: 

Usually, the price of our taxi charge from The Medical City to Sta. Mesa, V. Mapa via San Juan takes only up to P100-110 or even lesser with moderate traffic. But this time, it charged us P148 and went to 152 as he tried to move forward a little bit and did not even tried to give us the exact change for P200. He charged us P155 and I notice that he was in a hurry cutting through different lanes even though it's midnight. I did not want to argue with him because he might have weapons or such inside his taxi so I just paid him the amount regretfully. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
