title: UVF303 - from F. Blumentritt San Juan to San Miguel Ave. Pasig
---

### Name of taxi: Kristine Jane

boarded at f. blumentritt san juan. noticed that the driver pressed only the radio and not the meter. try to pretend i was fixing my shoe and saw that meter was not started, i am not hundred percent sure that's why i didn't react. at the same time i am scared to react as he might do something against me. then when i arrived at the destination, driver scratched his head and say "ay! nakalimutan ko metro" then i didnt argue and tell him i knew it from the start as modus is so common. 

```No meter```
