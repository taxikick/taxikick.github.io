### Name of taxi: Adarlo trans

Ride at export bldg to v-corporate centre which costs me Php64.50 on his meter. As far as i know, there's a minus php10 until today so i paid php55. He get my attention and told me that i gave him not enough payment. So i told him that there's minus php10 on flag down. He said it was cancelled laat week. So instead of arguing, i just gave him php10.

I forgot to ask for a receipt.
