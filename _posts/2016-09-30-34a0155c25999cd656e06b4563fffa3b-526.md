title: TYS197 - From Resorts World Manila to Mall of Asia
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

We hailed this taxi at Sales Road a few meters from Resorts World Manila across Villamor Air Base. He asked us our destination and he agreed so we got in. I noticed there was no flag down rate indicated in the meter. And it doesn't look like the usual meter on other taxis. He explained bluntly that the meter is not like the usual because it doesn't have flag down and it doesn't move when the vehicle is on stop. He also said that per kilometer is PHP 10 only. That is also what my friend heard and understood. To cut the story short, we got to Mall of Asia incurring 7 kms and were told that fare is PHP 700.00 (PHP 100/km). That's insane. But we had no choice but pay him and just hoped that his greediness will get back at him someday.
