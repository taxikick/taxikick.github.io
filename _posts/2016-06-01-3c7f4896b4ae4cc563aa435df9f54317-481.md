### Name of taxi: Keith Michelle

The driver asked for an additional P50 as it was raining and he said there's traffic on the way to UPA Technohub. It was the only available cab after waiting for almost 30mins, so I had no choice. We didn't encounter any traffic en route but he still asked for the P50 and said "Di ko nga sinakay yung mas malapit e". He also went over the speed limit of 60 at Commonwealth Ave. 

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
