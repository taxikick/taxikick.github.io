### Name of taxi: lameass taxi

Happy Sunday! 
I hailed a taxi in Robinsons Galleria and told the cab driver to take me to Renaissance PASIG. He said, "Saan don?" 
I replied, "Sa Ayala the 30th mall po". 
I assumed that he was just going to drive around Galleria and turn right to EDSA shrine which will lead him to Meralco Avenue but he swerved his way to EDSA.
I reminded him that it was Ayala Pasig.
The driver shouted , AY PUTA ! DI MO SINABE! 

Worst part was when I told him about Ayala 30th we were still in a area where he could turn away to avoid the long winding road of EDSA. He kept driving purpose so that it will impossible to turn back to Meralco Avenue.

"Maam dagdag na lang po kayo ng 50 pesos kita mo ang traffic oh. " 

This is really disrespectful and unprofessional of him. And he continued babbling in bisaya saying it was my fault na hindi ko nilinaw. Clearly, he was lashing his mistake at me. I decided to get off the vehicle somewhere near Megamall. No passenger deserves to be treated with that response. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
