### Name of taxi: *forgot

We live somewhere in San Antonio Village, Makati and we decided to take a cab to work in a hurry. Our office is located along Ayala only. This taxi stopped by us when we called him, asked us where we're headed but after learning our destination, he refused us. Picky driver! Super lapit na lang ng destination namin, ayaw pa. 

```Refused boarding```
