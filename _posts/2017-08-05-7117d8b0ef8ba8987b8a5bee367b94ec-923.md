### Name of taxi: Unknown

Was waiting for my bus to arrive at the loading area when this rude taxi driver went over the gutter and moved backwards bumping me. I didn't notice he was there because I was reading bus' signboards. He should've beeped instead of driving his car backwards to notify me that he's there. Once and for all, it's not meant for vehicles to park on that area. He didn't apologize or whatsoever. Please take action over this rude taxi driver. 

```Rude behavior```
