### Name of taxi: Unknown

He automatically started the meter when we are trying to load up our things, he is so rude. He also told us that he wants to gas up then if we decline and if its out of gas we will push the car, after that he over charge and wants to contract plus 50 pesos. 

```Over charging, Contracting```
