title: UYE136 - SM Masinag

### Name of taxi: --

We had our kids checked in a clinic directly across SM Masinag. My husband was carrying our 1-year-old kid, I was in charge of our 3-year-old kid. After the check-up, we went to SM Masinag  thinking it would be easier for us to find a ride home since SM has a taxi bay. Only a few cabs were available but luckily, the queue wasn't that long - in fact, we were 3rd in line. When it was our turn, my husband opened the one of the doors and asked the driver to take us to Cubao. However, the driver refused and said "Hindi na ko umaabot dun." Then he moved past us a bit to wait for another passenger. Husband and I then decided to turn on our data to Grab a ride instead. This is one of the main reasons why most people prefer GRAB/UBER.
