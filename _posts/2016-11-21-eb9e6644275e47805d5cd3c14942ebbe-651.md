title: UVP180 - Quezon Ave and Araneta Ave
---

### Name of taxi: Sturdy Taxi

 The driver was driving the taxi at around 100KMH even though there is a large volume of vehicle on the road and was so reckless that there were several times we almost hit a truck along Quezon Ave and Araneta Ave. He keeps on flashing his lights and blowing his horn to any vehicle that is in front of him.

When I confronted him about his way of driving he gave a comment that I should just step out of the vehicle if I don't like his way of driving.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
