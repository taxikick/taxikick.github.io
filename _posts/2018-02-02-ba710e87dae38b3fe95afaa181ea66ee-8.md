title: 4YT265 - Airport to Valero Street

### Name of taxi: yellow airport taxi

The driver cheated by charging me with an amount of the taxi daily sales report of 688 peso where the fare should be around 300 peso. (on a sunday evening 930pm where there is no traffic). I paid 688 peso only to realize the "receipt" was a daily sales report instead of single fare receipt.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
