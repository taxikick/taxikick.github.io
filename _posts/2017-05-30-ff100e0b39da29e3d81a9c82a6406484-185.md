### Name of taxi: Unknown

We boarded his taxi at EDSA Kamuning (near Jam bus terminal) bound to Victory Liner Cubao Terminal. When we arrived at our desired place he charged us 100 pesos, it is obvious that the trip will not exceed 100 pesos and my major concern is that he did not used his taxi meter.

```Over charging, No meter```
