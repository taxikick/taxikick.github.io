title: UWK193 - Valero Street

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Hindi namin napansin na hindi po siya gumamit ng metro kasi nagmamadali narin kami, We're from Estrada Street, Malate going to Valero Street. Supposedly the fare should be less than 100 pesos only since its Saturday, less traffic and we took it for more or less 5 mins only but the Taxi Driver charged us 100 pesos which is higher than the usual rate we are paying. 

```Over charging, No meter```
