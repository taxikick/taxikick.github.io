### Name of taxi: Renjay

During my trip, i ask the driver if he have a receipt and he said that he dont have. And then i ask why the meter is not running he told be that because the rate is fixed  i ask how will i know my fare? He said that the fare is fixed for 350. I told him that its too expensive. I even told him that during may way to naia terminal 1 i pay the uber for only 240 pesos so how come its 350? He didnt respond. 

```No meter, No receipt```
