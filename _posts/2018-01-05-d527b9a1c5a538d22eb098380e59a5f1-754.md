### Name of taxi: Forgot

I waited for more than 30 mins in Glorietta 4 taxi stand until finally a got a cab. The driver have asked where I will be going and have said that it's in Washington Makati which probably around 3km from Glorietta. Hopped inside the cab when the driver start saying that he wanted to earn more. In my mind I knew what he meant, either he wanted to get more money by over charging or he wanted to ditch me out of his cab. So I asked what he meant when he said he wanted to earn more then he said I don't really like to go to Washington in a rude tone of voice. I told the driver that I'll just get off his cab and will report him. 

```Rude behavior```
