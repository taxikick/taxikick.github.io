### Name of taxi: unknown

Around 3:30am we took the taxi at BLTB Terminal Buendia. I gave the driver a print-out of the map to Providence Village in Makati. We boarded in haste as we were late. About 10mins. on the way I glanced at the meter, it had lighted buttons and paper receipt attached to it. I should've confirmed that the meter was running that time. When we got to the destination, we asked how much and driver quoted us p300. I asked him why it's so  high, didn't he turn the meter on? (his windshield has stickers proving his meter is tried and tested). He replied: "eh, naghanap pa kasi tayo eh". I was about to argue but my friend said to let it go. All I could do was snap a photo of the taxi's plate number painted on the inside door.
