title: TYE784 - Victory Liner Cubao Station
---

### Name of taxi: M.G.E.

I disembarked in VICTORY LINER,CUBAO at around 2am. Inside the station, 3 men approached me, and asking if I need a Taxi, 2 drivers and 1 porter. I told them I need to take a Bus going to Tagaytay and it is somewhere in TAFT ave. Along EDSA where they are waiting for passengers. The driver took my things and put it in the back of the car. The taxi parked at the back of the Station. The driver had some talks with the guard and drive. Initially I requested for the meter but the driver asked for P350. I told him I will take another Taxi, he kept on driving and lowered his asking price to P250. I insisted to turn on the meter because I wanted to pay a fair price. He agreed but asking P50 on top of the bill. I told him, the passengers should be the one to decide how much to add on the payment and not him demanding for the money. In the end, he stopped the car in somewhere dark in EDSA, took of my baggages from the compartment and asked me to pay P50 for the meter. I didn't complain anymore, but I feel like crying because he is so unfair, I am also scared not to pay him, for he can hit me anytime in a place where nobody is passing by. 

```Over charging, No meter```
