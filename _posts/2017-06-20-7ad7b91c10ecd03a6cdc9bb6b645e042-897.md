### Name of taxi: Don't know

Son and i tried to ride a metered taxi. Wasn't able to get a grabcar which will only cost me 200 pesos flat rate. Because my son fell asleep and i was carrying him. So i hailed a metered taxi instead. Meter charge is only 215. I already gAve him 220. But he wasn't accepting it. He wanted 250 instead. Since my child was asleep and i wanted to take my son inside the house already i just gave him 250

```Over charging```
