### Name of taxi: didn't see

Went through the Taxi Bay but did not pick up any passengers. We were in a long line and it was approached but the doors were locked and it just drove off. Also, since it did the exact same thing, I will mention another taxi: license plate ACA4928. It dropped off a passenger at the entrance of the same Taxi Bay yet went straight through without stopping long enough for a passenger to get in.

```Refused boarding```
