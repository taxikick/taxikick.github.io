title: UWD-730 - Hampton Gardens Pasig to Robinsons Equitable Tower Ortigas

### Name of taxi: ROCELLE TRANS SERVICE

Meter running too fast. My usual fare from Pasig to Ortigas ranges from 90 to 120. But earlier, the fare was 176.50. There was no traffic from Pasig to Tiendesitas, yet the fare is already 100 pesos. Then, there was a moderate and moving traffic along Julia Vargas.

Not sure if my assumption was right but here are the receipt details:

Plate #: UWD-730
Start Time: 08:29
End Time: 09:01
Waiting Time: 00:29
Travel (km): 7.5
TOTAL FARE: 176.50

```Tampered or broken meter```
