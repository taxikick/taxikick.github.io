title: UVL-788 - Glorietta 4
---

### Name of taxi: MPP

We rode a cab from Cybergate Pioneer and noticed that its meter runs so fast. Boni is just one station away from Guadalupe but the bill was already at 100 pesos,mind you there's no traffic when it happened around 9 am this morning. When we reached Glorietta, the final bill reached 200 pesos and the funny part was when we confronted the driver and told him that the normal price must only be around 120-140 from Boni-Glorietta, driver was so defensive telling us he has no clue and his meter was newly sealed. We are regular taxi users and this kind of behavior is not tolerable. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
