### Name of taxi: Unknown

the taxi driver once we said our place was in mcu caloocan he was hesistant and told us that he has no meter and asked for a charge to 300php. It's not about the price but the fact that he doesnt have a meter and it's overpriced and trying to deal with a contract. It was morning so no traffic at all so no need to make a deal. 

```Refused boarding, Over charging```
