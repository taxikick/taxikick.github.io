### Name of taxi: Magnificent Taxi? Or Magnificat? Di ako sure

I didn't ride in this taxi but I saw what happened. The taxi driver was swerving left and right without using signal lights and is hotheaded, almost rammed into another car that had signal lights on for turning the right way, BLOCKED THAT CAR'S PATH AND PROCEEDED TO GO DOWN AND THREATEN AND SHOUT AT THE OTHE DRIVER IN COMMONWEALTH. He left his passenger in the car while he proceeded to act like a madman, causing unnecessary traffic. May babae pa siyang pasahero. Caused traffic just to shout at another driver kahit na siya talaga may mali kasi swerve nang swerve na di man lang nagsisignal

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
