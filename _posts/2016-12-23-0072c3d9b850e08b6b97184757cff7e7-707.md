### Name of taxi: Metered Metro

Asked us where our destination is before we even got inside the cab. My companion told him to use UN Ave as his route and he answered "kahit di mo sabihin doon talaga ko dadaan" in a bad tone. Reckless driving with the trucks in San Marcelino St. When we were near our destination I told him to turn left and he asked me if there's actually a way in/out so I said yes, he told me that I should have told him where were going!! (I told him exactly where our destination is when we got inside the cab btw!!!)

```Choosing passengers, Reckless driving```
