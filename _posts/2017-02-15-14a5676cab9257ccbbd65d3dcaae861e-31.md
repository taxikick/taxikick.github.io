### Name of taxi: Not recorded

I consider this metering on distance is a scam that staff at the regular taxi stand at terminal 3 are in on.
I was to trusting and failed to notice the driver failed to have flag fall price but instead distance in meters.Driver ask 950php for a distance of 4 kilometers. If you want  tourism you need to clean up the scams
