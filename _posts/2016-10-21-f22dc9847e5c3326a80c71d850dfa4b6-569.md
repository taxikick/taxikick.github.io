### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was waiting for a grab taxi service to send items to someone.  Coincidentally this taxi cab arrived and driver acted as if he was expecting me.  "Ah ikaw pala yun, ito ba. Akala ko kasama ma" Gave details of booking(dropoff) to confirm. He took the items (obviously not intended for him) and left.  Realizing my mistake, reported immediately to the Grab kiosk.  Taxi cab driver was "inactive".  Obviously driver took advantage of the confusion of the moment.

```Left behind items, Malicious mischief```
