### Name of taxi: Dan & Jen

A lane hogging taxi didn't want to let us pass even though we were almost halfway through the lane. What he did was he purposely got in the way of us merging into the lane hitting our side view mirror. He gave us a nasty look while my father (a senior) said sorry, yet we did nothing wrong. I stared back at hing giving him an evil eye. I went down and we started shouting at each other. He began giving me the finger. I fired back by showing him that I was taking a picture of his taxi. That ended the verbal war.
