### Name of taxi: I forgot the name

There was heavy rain and strong wind when my mother, who is 72 years old and my 10 yr old niece was trying to get the taxi driver's service to bring them home which is just a few kilometers away from the hospital . Considering of the heavy rains and strong wind that  and its almost approaching 12 mn, the driver never considered the situation... he said was heading on the direction to cubao.
