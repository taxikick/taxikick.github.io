title: TXK751 - Pasig City

### Name of taxi: ECIMYK

i hailed the cab near pasig city hall and advised the driver i would need to go to eastwood city, qc. instead of turning left and going the way to Bg. Ilog Pasig> C5 (which is the most efficient way for us) he turned right and followed the route for jeepneys. i told him to follow the route i advised him as it would only take us farther if he follows the jeepney route- and whats the point of hailing a cab which is more expensive that a jeepney if we will just follow the route of the normal jeepney travel? then the driver started being angry with me, raising his voice and raising his point that he did not made "kontrata" with me, etc. i explained to him that the route i told him is faster and that he should have followed it as it is the usual route i have whenever i take the cab to work. then suddenly he blurted out "bumaba na kayo" thats the time i raised my voice and said "wag mo ako ibababa dito sa alanganin na lugar pinara kta sa maayos na lugar subukan mo". after his shouting and his arguments i went down in pasig rotonda and told him "see you in LTFRB"
