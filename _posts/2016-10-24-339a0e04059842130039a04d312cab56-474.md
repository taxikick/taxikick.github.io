### Name of taxi: Nikkan

The taxi driver wants the long way and when he was told of the short way he was saying in a loud voice what if he cant turn left or what if he will be caught even though its okay to turn left in that area and we were using that route several times. Upon paying he was yelling at me that he only have 20 pesos 50 pesos for change and even instructed me to get for a change while the meter was on even if i already arrived. He even yelled at me when when I asked about the minus 10 pesos fare, he said "wala nay minus 10 ron dai".
The driver was rude and was yelling at me, also pretending not to know which route to take knowing he's a taxi driver.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
