title: UVD116 - STO. DOMINGO, QUEZON CITY

### Name of taxi: CAN'T REMEMBER

I boarded the taxi with plate number UVD 116 with GRAB sign and asked him to drive to Libis. Driver said he could not go to Libis, QC because his way was to Manila & Paranaque.  I alighted the taxi and found a new one.  While inside another taxi, I caught the driver of the reported taxi still waiting in front of the Sto. Domingo Church, I rolled down its window, and told this driver I am going to report him to LTFRB.  He swore and said "Putang ina mo" while the taxi I rode is leaving.
