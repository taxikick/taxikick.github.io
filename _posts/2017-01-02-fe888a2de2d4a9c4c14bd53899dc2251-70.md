### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was in the bus terminal with my sisters at passed 4am. Pinara ko yung taxi then tumigil siya. He asked for the drop-off point and I said "Blumentritt Espanya po". He simply said "Pa-fairview ako eh"  then left the terminal. 

I wonder why he is a taxi driver when clearly, he wants to be a jeppney or Fx driver. ðŸ˜‚
