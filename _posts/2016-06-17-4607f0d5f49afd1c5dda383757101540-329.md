### Name of taxi: Donman

Awhile ago my sister sent me a text that she was riding a taxi and she texted me the plate number. She told me the taxi driver would drop her off in Basak (half way from home) because he would be returning home already. But after a minute sinabi nang driver na pwedi naman daw niyang idrop ang sister ko sa exact location nang bahay namin kaso mag chacharge daw siya nang double. I asked her immediately to send me the name of the taxi driver kaso hindi daw niya makita yung name. Natakot naman daw siyang mag ask. 

```Over charging, Contracting```
