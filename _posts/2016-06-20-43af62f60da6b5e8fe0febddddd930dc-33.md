---

### Name of taxi: 

We boarded with my brother and his girlfriend around lrt d. Jose station. Immediatley after we boarded, the driver arogantly told us that he is a hotel taxi service and he has a different rate. He told us that every minutes he would charge us a certain amount. We did not really understand it in details about his explaination on his special rate. We panic because as the way we understood it, we will be charge for a very big amount that is why we decided to just unboard the taxi in the middle of the trip. We are going to sm aura but we unboard at ariund the central station near the manila city hall. Thae taxi arogantly ask for a 280 pesos fare and not letting us go out his taxi without paying him first. I cant do anything because we are just 2 girls and my younger brother. We got his plate number but we disnt get the taxi company name. UWG 705 Is the plate number color white taxi. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
