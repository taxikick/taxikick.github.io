title: UVA-396 - From Philcoa to Project 4
---

### Name of taxi: TWASCO Metered taxi

I said "kuya project 4 po" then he said okay. As I sat down and he started driving he said "maam, service taxi po ito ha, every 100 meters, additional 2 pesos po" and he didnt start the meter yet. When I said "ay kuya baba na lang po ako" and then he started the meter and said "sige po metro na lang". 

```Over charging, Contracting```
