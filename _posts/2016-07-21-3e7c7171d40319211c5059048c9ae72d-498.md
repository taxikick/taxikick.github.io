### Name of taxi: 

I instructed the driver that he needs to drop me off on our building's lobby. After a fee minutes near our destination, I reminded him again and to my surprise he was acting so rude. He kept on telling "oo na nga kanina pa paulit ulit. Kaya nga nasa kaliwa." He was very rude and unfriendly towards his passenger.

```No receipt, Reckless driving```
