### Name of taxi: Grab taxi

The base fare that is shown in my grab taxi app is 40pesos, that's why I booked a ride. But then before he dropped me to my location, he said the base fare is 70 and it is shown upon booking. But its not! It actually says that the estimated fare is P123-168. But I paid 180. He said he will send me an e-receipt "later", but i didnt receive any. I have a proof, i have a screenshot of my grab taxi booking. I know its just a short amount, but i dont want to tolerate that kind of doing. It is not right. We're all working here, let's be fair to everyone. People like that should learn their lessons.
