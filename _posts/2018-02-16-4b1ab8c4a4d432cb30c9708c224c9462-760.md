### Name of taxi: City Rose Trans

He claimed he didn't have any change for my 100 bill. The fare was 80 pesos. I said I only have 76. He refused to accept it since,  he said, it's unfair for him. I said it would be more unfair for me if he will not give me any change for my 100. I said I will search my bag for coins so that my 76 pesos will reach his 80 peso bill. He then got irritable and said I was wasting his time. He wanted me to get off the cab, but I said, I will search for loose change so that he will have change for his other passengers. He kept on saying I was wasting his time and there was no use waiting and that the meter will just keep on running. I refused to get off and I finally found a 10peso coin. I gave him 85 then and got off. It is just frustrating to come from a 12 hour shift and deal with abusive drivers like him. On a normal day, I would have been kinder. But saying that I was wasting his time looking for some change is very unacceptable.
