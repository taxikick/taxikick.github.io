### Name of taxi: Hadjie Taxi

i asked the driver to take the north reclamation area route to cansaga bridge since its less traffic in that area, he agreed however he was cursing all the time. When i reached my destination he even asked me for the additional 10 pesos on my metered fare. He was very very rude. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
