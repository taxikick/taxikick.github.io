title: UVV399 - I have gotten used to taking a cab going to work in Technohub from my dorm in Park 9 Alley Katipunan for months now - taking the Tandang Sora path always. On the average, the fare is only at around 100 pesos and, most of the time, it is exactly at that amount (99.50). It may come up to 110 pesos but that is the highest already. This morning I rode a taxi from my dorm like the usual and had clearly seen the seconds in the driver's meter go up at a relatively faster rate later on. True enough, when we had reached the unloading area of my office building, the meter registered around 130 pesos. I actually took photos of the meter at the entrance of Techohub, by the guard's checkpoint booth, and told the driver that it was the first time that ever happened - that the fare went up and beyond 100 pesos like that and he told me to pay him what I usually pay for and, of course, I did because I wasn't paying that kind of amount when I know, based on experience, that it can not reach that amount even with traffic but there was no traffic earlier. I am reporting this so other customers taking that taxi with the old man driver (didn't get his name and I don't know whether the Technohub guards at the checkpoint log the cab drivers' names).
