### Name of taxi: Scorpion

He asked us to pay additional 100 pesos on top of the metered charge. He was saying nasty comments. When we arrived in our destination and payed plus the additional 100 pesos he doesn't seem happy about it. We asked if he's okay. He made a rude comment. He already overcharged us, we payed him yet he isn't happy about it.

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
