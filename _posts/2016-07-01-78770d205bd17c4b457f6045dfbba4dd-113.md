### Name of taxi: M.G.E.

My friend and her companion rode this taxi at Robinson's Place. As they entered the cab, the driver was playing loud music. My friend asked if the driver's receipt machine was working but did not respond. Then, she asked again and then he shouted "Ayan o nakikita mo na nga eh" and shouted the same statement again. They also noticed that he was under the influence of alcohol based on his speech and odor.
