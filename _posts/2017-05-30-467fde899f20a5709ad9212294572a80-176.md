### Name of taxi: Pabex Trans.

AAO 6512 
Driver was arrogant and rude, saying he shouldn't have picked us up if he knew we wanted to take a different route. He doesn't have and ID inside the taxi either. Lastly, he made a call in the middle of driving, complaining that his taxi has problems. 

```Rude behavior, Texting while driving```
