### Name of taxi: Not sure 

I told the driver to drop me off at Buendia lrt station, then he has a disclaimer that his taxi is a non meter and the rate is 15 minutes per meter. I asked him if that is legal had he said that he's from transport group. I have no idea what he's talking about. I told him to drop me off at the nearest drop off point so that I could no longer be charged higher. Then charge me Php 135 for 900 meter. Omg! The normal rate of that point to point destination is less than 60 pesos. I understand that he inform me about it but to be charged that big amount was totally unacceptable. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
