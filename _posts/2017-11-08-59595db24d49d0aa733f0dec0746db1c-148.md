### Name of taxi: Forgot

He stops at two gasoline stations.the meter was from 54 pesos when he start to run us to our destination it was already 75 pesos. So i ask him to minus the diffrence to make it fair since charge us even if the car wasnt running. He was also taking calls while gassing up and then few minutes after he took another call until we reach the destination..it was clearly reckless driving..

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
