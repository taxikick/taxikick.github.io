title: AVA1282 - From greenbelt 1 to Ascott, BGC Taguig
---

### Name of taxi: 

Upon entering the cab (AVA 1282), the driver asked for additional Php.30 on top of his meter. I rode from Greenbelt 1 going to Ascott BGC, Taguig. Upon arriving at Ascott, he asked me to pay him 300, but the meter only showed Php. 142 and he won't let me go down the cab without me paying him 300.

```Over charging, No receipt```
