### Name of taxi: Jonie

Rode the taxi at DFA. Told driver to drop me off naia. It was almost 2pm. He refused to use the meter and instead asked me php300. I said that is too big and i insisted to use the meter. He said it is traffic on the way there and he wont be getting any passengers from the terminal. I refused to pay 300. But since im almost late for my flight and carrying a heavy bag. I haggled. And we agreed Php250. But on the way to the airport, there was no traffic at all. And when about to pay, i saw the meter only Php117. I still paid him 250 but i said i"ll definitely complain because pres.duterte doesnt allow drivers doing that and he answered "hindi pa naman sya nakaupo". I'll never want this driver ever do it to other people. Please act on it. Thanks.
