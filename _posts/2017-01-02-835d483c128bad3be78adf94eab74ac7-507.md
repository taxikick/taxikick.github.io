### Name of taxi: Dikonapansin

Passed 4 am today, me and my sisters were at the bus terminal. We were from Laguna and we want to hire a taxi so that we can go to Blumentritt Rd. (Along espanya) Sampaloc, Manila. This driver approached us and asked where are we heading. I told him where then he said "250 nalang mam, matraffic dun ngayon". I asked him if we can use his meter. He said "300 nga po pag may metro". I said "wag na kuya. Wala pa pong 150 papunta dun at this hour. Every week po kaming nauwi kaya di niyo po kami maloloko". Then he went away with his co-driver saying some things I can't even understand. After a while, i saw him approached another passenger with so many baggage (like bagssss and a sack of rice). The passenger agreed to his price. I feel bad for that passenger. Maybe he don't have a choice since 99.9% of the taxi drivers were taking advantage of the commuters.

Ps
I don't know the taxi's name that's why I put "dikonapansin"
