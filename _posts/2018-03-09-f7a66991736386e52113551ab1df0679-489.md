### Name of taxi: Unknown

I was on my way home when I decided to ride a taxi. I asked if pwede siya papunta don galo, para√±aque. He quickly said yes. Then when I was already seated at the back of the car, he said "mam padagdagan na lang po ha." I said, "bakit po magdadagdag kuya, wala naman po traffic dun." He said, "wala po makukuhang pasahero pabalik. Pero kayo na po bahala mam." Then, dead air. When we already reached my destination, I gave him a 500 peso bill, waiting for my change. He gave me a 300 peso. 200 daw charge nya sken kasi wala daw siya makukuha pasahero pabalik. Sa meter is 159 peso lang. This should not be tolerated. 

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
