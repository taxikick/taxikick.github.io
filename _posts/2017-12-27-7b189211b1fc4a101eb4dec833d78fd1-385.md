### Name of taxi: LYNGAIL

First offense: Rejecting passengers - I was the second passenger to hail this cab, since the first passenger was immediately rejected by the driver. 

Second offense: When I got in and I told him that my destination is inside a village in Brgy. Rosario, Pasig City, he immediately remarked that he will only drive along the main road and will only bring me up to the village's gate. Since it was raining and I really just wanted to get home, I complied rather than stepping out of the cab and having to wait for another one. 

Third offense: Throughout the ride, he was cursing and bad mouthing the other drivers, the weather, and traffic situation. I felt extremely uncomfortable and just wanted the ride to end. 

Fourth: Upon reaching my village's gate, I reached for a bill and paid the driver. The driver didn't even move, as if expecting that I wouldn't request the change. I told him to at least give me the change since he didn't drive me to my home and I still have to walk a long way. The driver said he didn't have change (although I doubt this). He also didn't issue a receipt. 

Overall, I felt very bad throughout the ride. I feel as if I overpaid for a very bad service, for which I didn't even reach home and still had to walk a long way. The worst part is, the driver wasn't even apologetic. 

```Choosing passengers, No receipt```
