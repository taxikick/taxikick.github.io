### Name of taxi: 

I told him that Bayan Park road has a one way road. The driver did not listen and he even told me that if he gets caught, I should pay him 500 pesos.  I answered "sinabihan ko na po kayo kuya at bakit ako magbabayad?" He told me, "siyempre ikaw anv sakay ko eh". I didn't say a word afterwards. Then a van came towards us, its driver got angry saying "nakikita mo na ngang one way to ipipilit mo pa". The driver of the taxi I was in answered back saying "wala kang pakialam hindi ikaw nagpapakain sakin.

```No receipt, Reckless driving```
