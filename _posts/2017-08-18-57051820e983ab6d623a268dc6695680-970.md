### Name of taxi: Not sure

I gave him instructions on how to get to the destination yet he did not follow and just went on his way so he can charge me more. 

When he did not follow the instructions, he even slowed down his car. When he was about to speed up the pace, he noticed a Coca-Cola Truck and intentionally tried to hit the truck so he could be first on line. He was even taunting them by slowing down so the truck won't pass by anymore. 

He turned down the air conditioner and asked me the directions again. I told him politely to turn on the aircon but he did not. I wanted to stop and go out from the taxi but he gave me a threatening look. I froze. When we were almost there, He stopped for 2 minutes to call his friend who is walking on the other side of the road. I don't want other people to experience what I've experienced. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
