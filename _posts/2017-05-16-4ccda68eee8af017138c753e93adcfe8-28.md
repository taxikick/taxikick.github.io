### Name of taxi: Unknown

There is something wrong with the meter of the taxi. It's so fast and resulted to overcharging. My destination is from Gateway to Mckinley, usually the charge will be around 190-210 but today, I was charged 271. The ride was so smooth and no hassle, it's just something is wrong with the meter. It's so fast

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
