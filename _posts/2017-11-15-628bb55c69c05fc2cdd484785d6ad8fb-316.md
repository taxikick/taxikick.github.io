### Name of taxi: JTY

He was angry cause he wanted the foreigner and I was first in line so I was the one allocated to him. This hoe was harass and was mad when I told him which route to take and I even told him to park properly cause I was stopping near the school and I told him to just press the hazard button cause a car was behind us but he replied "bahala na sila diha!". what a douche!
