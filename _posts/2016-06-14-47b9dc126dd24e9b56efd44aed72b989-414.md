### Name of taxi: J CAR TAXI

The driver was not attentive. He admitted that he was sleepy. He contracted me 350 pesos for a ride. Because he's sleepy he drove slower than normal. When we arrived at the destination and saw that it's 344 in the meter, he told me to make the fare to 400 which is way TOO much. He also told me that less 10 pesos in taxi is not anymore applicable. FYI, my normal fare from previous rides in taxi is ranging from 280-300 pesos only for the same pick up location to the destination.

```Over charging, Contracting```
