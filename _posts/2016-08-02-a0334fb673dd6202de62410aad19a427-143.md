title: AWD303 - In market market driver was in queue. Drop off point was suntrust parkview near sm manila. The meter was 187. I gave 207 so he can give a 20 pesos change. He mentioned it should be 200 because it is far. He insisted that he will not give any change to 200. No heavy or moderate traffic was encountered. This is overcharging. Rude behavior
