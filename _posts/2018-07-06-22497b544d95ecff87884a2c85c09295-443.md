### Name of taxi: Not sure

Driver agreed to drive us to our specified location but told us to add to the fee since it was traffic but we still agreed. On the way to our location, he told us that he would transfer us to another taxi since he got a call from Grab but we didn't answer him so he still drove us to our destination but he was rude and reckless all the time during the ride and we had to go in circles in Pembo, Makati because he did not pay attention to what we said and was in a foul mood all the while

```Over charging, Contracting```
