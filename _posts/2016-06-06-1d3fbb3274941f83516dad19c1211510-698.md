### Name of taxi: RYO AKI

Windows were open. Asked why and then rudely answered back what the hell was i thinking and i said of course would like to know. Windows are usually closed. Asked if there's anything wrong with his a/c or with the taxi. Since he entered the taxi bay and i was with my kids and a senior citizen in tow, i had to be sure if the ride was safe. He muttered bad words and sped away. Those rude drivers should have their licenses confiscated, pay penalty or not drive at all! Bastos! 

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
