title: UVX500 - NAIA Terminal 1 - OHAYAMI Trans Sampaloc
---

### Name of taxi: Rolli Polli

We were bound for Cubao but the taxi driver suggested for sampaloc since bus terminals can also be found there.
We rushed in and observed that the meter is not on. He even told us that we should add 200 pesos if there would be traffic and charged us with a fixed price of 1000 php. Even though he told us that we were his "Kababayans" because we speak the same dialect, he still charged us with such amount.

```Over charging, No meter```
