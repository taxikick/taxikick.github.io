### Name of taxi: Jaynesson

I am reporting this incident in behalf of my Boss, he is a Japanese and he do business trips in Philippines to keep up with our Philippine partners. Yesterday (05/07/2017) he message that he encounter this incident by this rude Taxi driver who is asking for 350 pesos payment and my Boss refused to pay that because as usual he just paying 120 from Pasay Heritage Hotel to Naia Terminal, so what the driver do he locked the door and trying to start again the car, my Boss bargained to just pay 200 pesos instead but the driver keeps on forcing him to pay 350 pesos. In addition, my Boss ask first for the meter and the driver said yes. If you want the images/video I can send it to you.

```Over charging, No meter```
