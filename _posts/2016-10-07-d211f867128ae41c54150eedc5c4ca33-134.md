### Name of taxi: Uber Cab

The driver was rude and gave me a discriminatory look when I gave him the destination and looked at me like he was frustrated when I told him where to go. Taxi driver had his seat reclined too far that it was blocking the seat behind him. He was not wearing his seatbelt, loud, using his cellphone, increased the volume of the radio and even has his feet up while driving. He was even rude while I was requesting that he lift his seat up, he did initially but kept on reclining it. When I paid my fare, he showed his frustration when I handed him a 500peso bill to pay for my 96peso fare.

```Rude behavior, No seatbelts```
