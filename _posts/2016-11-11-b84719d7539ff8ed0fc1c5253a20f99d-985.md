### Name of taxi: Unknown

I just forgot that the money I have in my wallet is a 500 peso bill, I need to pay 106php. The driver said "Tsk, wala akong barya!" So I tried to look at the pocket of my bag if I have money left there. I found 70php and some coins. So I said "Sorry manong, di po to aabot ng 106. Kung gusto nyo po eto 6pesos, penge po ng 400 jan para sakto na po. The driver didn't respond and just gave me 370php as a change and repeat what he said "Oh ayan, wala akong barya." I asked him, "130 po?" and again, he answered, "Wala akong barya na!"
It would be fine if he talked in nice way, but he didn't! I just told him "Grabe naman po kayong maningil!". I wasn't able to get the name of the driver but I got the plate # of the taxi.
