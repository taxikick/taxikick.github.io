### Name of taxi: I don't know

I was on my way to the airport. I asked him to switch on the metre he said he had to wait to get out. Once he did, i asked him to switch it on. He refused. Told me because of baggage he can't turn it on HE initially charged me 650 pesos. I was like no, I only had 300 and he was like ok. We were already on the highway and I couldn't get out. I felt he would have drive away with my luggage.

```Over charging, No meter```
