title: UVH841 - Naia terminal 3

### Name of taxi: Ran gen

After we are seated, the driver immediately told us that the fare is 300 pesos because his reason was there's a heavy traffic going there. We didn't agree on this and told him to use meter. It was until we arrived at the airport when we realized that our ride was not metered despite telling him earlier that we'll just use meter. 300 was really costly for a pasay-naia ride. God bless na lang sayo kuya!

```Over charging, No meter```
