title: UWC861 - Manila Ocean Park to Robinsons Manila
---

### Name of taxi: 

The taxi meter was Php68 as we arrived at our destination. We didn't have the exact amount so we gave Php100. He immediately grabbed the bill without giving us the change. He said he didn't have change for 100. So we produced Php80 (4 20peso bills) but he refused to receive it and just gave us 9pesos. We were charged 91pesos for a 68peso metered trip. We complained and asked for help at the security guard of Robinsons Manila but the driver still won't give us the exact change. The guard advised us to report the taxi driver's misconduct.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
