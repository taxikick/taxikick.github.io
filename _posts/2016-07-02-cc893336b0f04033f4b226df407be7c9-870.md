### Name of taxi: 

I took a taxi cab from Marcos Highway to TriNoma. At first the driver was smoking and asked me if its okay if he finish his smoking so that it wouldn't be put to waste. The driver was chatty and nice. I noticed that the meter was not switched on so I told the driver. He insisted that the meter was working and he'll just based the fare on the receipt. When we arrived at Trinoma I was shocked that the fare was P380! My usual fare from Marcos Highway-Trinoma is ranging from P220-250 with or without traffic. 

```Over charging, No meter```
