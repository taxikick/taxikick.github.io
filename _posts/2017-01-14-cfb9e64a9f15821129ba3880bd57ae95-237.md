### Name of taxi: no name

I only had 500 to pay the taxi. His rate was 160. He said he didn't have change so when we got to UST P Noval, he even asked me to go down and get my money changed from the stores nearby. It was super hassle. He said he only had 69 pesos in his change fund. So when i got to a store who turned my whole 500 peso into 1 hundreds, i gave him 200. He refused to give me back my change of 40 pesos because he said again that he doesn't have change. Jesus, he said before i  went down to run around PNoval that he had 69 pesos. And to top it off he was angry and rude about it despire saying "pasensya na". I had to let him go because i was on a huge rush and he was parked poorly. good bye 40 pesos and hello to a bad start to a tiring day thanks to this driver. Didn't get the additional details due to the rush. 

```Rude behavior, Not giving exact change```
