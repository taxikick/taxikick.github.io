title: AFA1031 - SM City Consolacion

### Name of taxi: Forgot

Taxi refused to convey us. The driver took other passenger instead leaving us under the heat of the sun with my 2 year old son. We are lining up in the taxi stand of SM Consolacion. When it was our turn, upon mentioning our destination to the taxi driver, he refused to convey us. He instead took a random passenger outside the mall premises. I was not able to took picture because I was carrying my 2 yr old son. The security guard actually seen the incident but there was no action coming from the guard.

```Refused boarding```
