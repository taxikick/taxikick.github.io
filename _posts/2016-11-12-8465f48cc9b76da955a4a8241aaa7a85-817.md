### Name of taxi: Griffin Taxi

We have a foreigner guest who left his luggage behind in one of their taxis: UZY 377. He took the taxi from Holiday Inn Manila Galleria (hotel in Ortigas area, ADB Ave). He was dropped off today in BGC. We hope we can still retrieve it since there are important documents and devices in the luggage. Also, published contact numbers are all unreachable.
