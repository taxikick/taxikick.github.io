### Name of taxi: Unknown

At first, He demanded additional 50 pesos since my destination (munoz) 'far'. But i didnt agree, i said to him that we can take via EDSA since its already 420am and no traffic, but before we proceed, he said that he will refuel first to the nearest gas station, from my pick up point to the gas station, the meter is already reached P80 (the gas station is out of way). I also felt that he is passing thru longer routes before we reached EDSA. I arrived in my destination fast at 4:45am, my meter reached P392 (i beleive its really over priced) I handed him P500, and give me P150. I asked him why i only recieved P150, then he said that there's additional P50. But i said to him that i didnt agree on that. He even said that he do not have enough 'barya' for my change. I even saw his money that is more than enough for my change. 

His Name is Enrique Tanguin (based the ID in front).

Please do necessary action to this.
