### Name of taxi: Elias Letty

The taxi went on a circuitous way to our destination because the driver said it was so traffic in the usual way. It would have been ok, but his manner when we arrived at our destination is inexcusable. He refuses to bring us to the street we were going because it was sloping downwards. Maybe his taxi couldnt handle it. But then again, how can the ltfrb approve of this when we know the conditions of the places in baguio city. Maybe they should just phase out these taxis that cant handle baguio city. Or its just the driver being rude. In this case, he should be punished. He is just marring the image of other good taxi drivers.
