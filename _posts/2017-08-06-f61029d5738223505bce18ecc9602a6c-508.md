title: ADC4481 - UST to Frisco
---

### Name of taxi: -

A few hours ago around 4:00 - 4:30 pm. We called a taxi to drive us home from UST to Project 8 instead of riding a jeep since we have travelled a long time from province to Manila. We hoped to get to our house as soon as possible but we decided to stop midway at Frisco since the meter already reached 220 pesos. I only noticed it when my mom talked to me about it and I have seen that from Fisher Mall which is 190 pesos already and miles away from Frisco it suddenly became 220 pesos. We told him to just drop us already since we would expected a higher price maybe 400 pesos when we reach Project 8 our supposed destination. He just advised us to just call a jeep instead of apologizing about his taxi meter. Project 8 to UST = 160 pesos. UST to Frisco = 220 pesos already??  "Matanda na nga, siya pa ang nanloloko" my mother said.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
