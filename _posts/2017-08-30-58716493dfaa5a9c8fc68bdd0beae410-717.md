title: AFA5799 - Victory Liner Bus Terminal Baguio City
---

### Name of taxi: AR ANN

We arrived 3:15 am at the Victory Liner Bus Terminal and took the next taxi in line, Ar Ann taxi with plate no. AFA 5799.  The driver did not even help the four (4) of us in loading our suitcases and bags and just told us "Buksan niyo na lang ang likod".  He asked us if it was our first time in Baguio and we said no but it is our first time to stay in V Hotel Apartel which is just 2.7 km away. We did not notice that the taximeter was not running.  In about 5 minutes, we arrived at the hotel and asked him how much the fare was. "P100 na lang".  That's when we realized he did not turn the meter on during the whole trip.  I did not get out of the cab and had to ask him 3 times "Bakit hindi niyo binaba ang metro, Kuya?"  He finally answered "Inaantok ako kaya nalimutan ko e".  My friend gave him the P100 bill before I could stop her.  I was not able to report the incident in Baguio because it was a Sunday and the day we left for Manila was a holiday.  We have been to Baguio almost every year.  All Baguio taxi drivers will return even a P1.00 change but not this one.   Unfortunately, we were not able to get his name.  According to the hotel staff, the fare should have been P60.00 at most.

```Over charging, No meter```
