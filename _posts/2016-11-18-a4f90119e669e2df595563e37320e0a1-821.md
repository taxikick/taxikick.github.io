### Name of taxi: MJM Transport

Okay, so this cab stopped in front of us and asked where we're goin. I was with my boyfriend who happened to be an expat (some greedy people think expats are walking atm) and he was goin to work. When we went inside i noticed that his meter is on already at 43.50, which i just ignored. But immediately when i told him im goin to Acacia Estates (costs 78.50php) and to drop off my boyfriend first to Mckinley since Im willing to pay him more as well (we always give extra to taxi drivers), he said i just need to pay him 250. I wasnt able to argue with him since my partner have to go to work as well even though we werent in a hurry. I was just so pissed off with his greed and the way he act while we were inside the cab. I got his plate number and the name of their transport company, but the strange thing is when i was getting the mobile number painted on the side of the door, it was missing one digit. I looked at the other door an it was the same. So i tried my best to look in his id in front of the car and i tried to dial it, but it cannot be reach. When we reached our location and the guard was asking for his id, he actually have 2 copies of id from his transport company displayed in the dash board. Even when our guard inside the village asked for his license, he lied and said the front guard already got it.
