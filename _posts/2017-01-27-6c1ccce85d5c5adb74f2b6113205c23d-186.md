title: UVL927 - From Buendia to Ayala cor Dela rosa
---

### Name of taxi: BLACKTOP

9:30am i was in Buendia and going to work. I know im already late if i ride a jeep so i decided to take taxi instead.
I was in the hurry so i didnt check the flagdown. by the way im sitting beside the driver.
we arrived on my office in ayala cor dela rosa at exactly 10am. 
i gave him 100 expecting it was enough. But he said "kulang to" i was shock because buendia to ayala is not that far. so I ask how much, and i was shock again when he said "350 sir" . i dont know what to do that time because im already late, i dont want trouble or argue with him that moment so i just give him 350. and then i took picture of the taxi hoping i can use it for reporting.
