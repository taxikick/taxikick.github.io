### Name of taxi: Unknown

This rude driver has no meter in his cab. When ask about the broken meter, he only said that "wala mam eh andito na eh" may usual rate ranges from 80 to 120. But he asked 150 and kept telling me that wala eh andito na. He is so rude and arrogant.  Why do people like this exist.

```No meter, Rude behavior```
