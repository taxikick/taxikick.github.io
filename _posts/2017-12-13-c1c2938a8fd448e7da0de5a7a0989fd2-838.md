title: ABG5361 - online booking and trip cancellation by most grab drivers to high demand
---

### Name of taxi: GRABCAR

Booked a trip from Cubao to Taguig, waited for an hour or so then the grabcar driver canceled my booking. And when you try and book again, the fare is now twice or thrice as much as the earlier cost.
