### Name of taxi: Didn't get it

I asked him to go to a specific route that I know, he agreed but then later on he turn right to a place and he shouted at me saying this is how to get there. I stopped talking then after that I noticed he is becoming reckless, he steps on the gas then stepping on the break all of a sudden, I almost hit my head he keeps on doing it then when we are already there he stepped on the gas again with a sudden break. The taxi is also smelly, no rear view mirror and it seems he is not the one on the ID, he doesn't wear a uniform and he smells. He is very rude I didn't get his name since the ID is not place somewhere near to be read. He is dark and short opposite to the ID Picture inside the taxi

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
