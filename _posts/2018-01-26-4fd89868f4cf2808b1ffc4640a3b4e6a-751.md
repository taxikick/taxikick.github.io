title: UVS211 - Ortigas to Cainta
---

### Name of taxi: SHYMEE

My mother (Senior Citizen) asked if the driver can make the Air Conditioning cooler. He rudely answered my mother that considering the fare they are paying, "Fan" is enough for them since there's heavy traffic in Ortigas and gasoline is expensive now. This is an unacceptable, rude and unnecessary reply to an innocent query.

```Rude behavior```
