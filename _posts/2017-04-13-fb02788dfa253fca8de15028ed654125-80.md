### Name of taxi: Unknown

We were waiting for taxi ride and driver stopped in front of us and asked where we were heading. We answered, "Tabok, Mandaue Kuya." He said he will not board us because he will go home. "Mugarahe na man ko." We replied "Ok Kuya". He then rudely replied in an insulting tone, "Nganu man mukuyog ka nako?!". In English, "Why you want to go with me?!". We were left shocked with this bastos attitude. When we were boarded by another taxi, we saw his cab and the driver himself just parked in the nearby restaurant, probably waiting for foreign customers. That's what taxi drivers do ib our area. They do not board locals but opt to board foreigners.

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
