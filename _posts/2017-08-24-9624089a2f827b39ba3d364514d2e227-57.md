### Name of taxi: I can't recall

Yeah, I usually wait for a cab, in front of my office which is Teleperformance EDSA Greenfield site, then, as he stopped in the Taxi lane, he first asked me as i'm trying to get in, where am I heading, then, as I told him my destination, he, then proactively stated about the additional 50.00php on top of my bill because it was traffic. I've been riding Cab since day one as I got hired in TP EDSA, and nobody had ever brought up the argument of adding charge on the bill since Shaw Boulevard is a very congested way and most of the time traffic. It never ended there, because as we're about to take the route straight through Shaw Boulevard, he decided to take the shortcut which I prefers to call LONGCUT because based on my experience it is longing my travel time. Then, overall, we're basically doing our own things instead while he's using his phone everytime we hit the red light that he really prefer because my meter is going.

```Over charging```
