---

### Name of taxi: We forgot the name of this taxi.

After my pregnant wife together with her sister boarded this taxi, he told my wife to pay P100 from buendia lrt going to Mall of asia without using his taxi meter. My wife agreed because she is very tired standing for a long time waiting for a taxi. They told this driver "Manong, pakibaba po kmi sa may dept store area malapit" so that my wife can take a few steps going to the dept store. The driver agreed. When they reach moa, he then turned his taxi in the wrong place where in he wanted my wife and her sister to leave his taxi because there is a new passenger waiting. My wife said "kuya diba dun tyo malapit dpat sa dept store?" then the driver replied "tskk.. May pasahero na sana!" he then turned the wheel so fast and went to the dept store area.

```Over charging, No meter```
