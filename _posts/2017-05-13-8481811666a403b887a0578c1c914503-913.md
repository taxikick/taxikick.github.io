### Name of taxi: Airland

I just want to ask if this driver's alibi that his meter needed some sort of load inorder for it to function. Coz he aint using his meter due to fact that its load was consumed. Is this real?
Though he asked me prior heading off if i know how much it would cost me leading to my specified destination which i know coz i usually take taxi

But my main concern is that the "load" part for the meter were ever true?

```No meter, No receipt```
