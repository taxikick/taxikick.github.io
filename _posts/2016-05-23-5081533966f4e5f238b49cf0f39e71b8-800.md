title: AWD135 - 4th corner 31st to Market! Market!

### Name of taxi: 

Asked to go to Market! Market! to ride a bus to Pacita, bringing a luggage. Offers ride to Laguna instead, while peeking maliciously from the rear view mirror and making innuendo. Grabbed my hand during payment and caressed it without consent, then refused to give the change without another handhold. 

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
