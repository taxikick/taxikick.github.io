### Name of taxi: RODAV taxi

when I'm inside the taxi, the driver told me that "maam we don't have meter because it was a fixed fare taxi, here is the fare lists, i was shocked that my bill was 1, 600 pesos. I asked him that he should told me before about the fixed meter before i entered the taxi.. he answered the hotel didn't inform you ma'am about this? I said no, i am expecting that it is a metered taxi, so i didn't ask them about that. Later on i am asking him if he had a receipt for the fare, and then he answered sorry ma'am we don't have a receipt, i said how can it be that you are operating public transportation without any receipt? Later on, he ask me that can i give him a money because the taxi needs to go to the gasoline station, so i gave him 1, 000 pesos because i don't have any money in my pocket,. After a while when i have arrived at my destination i asked for the help from my co workers, then they ask the driver where is the receipt and why the fare is too much? He ride his taxi and left without saying anything and run away from us. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
