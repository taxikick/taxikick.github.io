### Name of taxi: FE & (i dont remember)

This guy tricked me on giving my change which is supposedly worth 380 pesos. He parked at the center of the road and pressured me to exit the vehicle, not giving me a chance to count my change. He only gave me 220 pesos and the money was messy in a way that you cant count it properly.
