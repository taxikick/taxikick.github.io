### Name of taxi: Unknown

I don't know if got an exact platenumber or only a temporary plate. Anyway I still want complain about this taxi since he refused us to ride his taxi. He is the same as any other taxi driver who refused to drive us to our destination.
He asked me first about the destination and when I answered him that we are going to Mintal which approximately 7 to 9 nine km. away, then he started to make his alibies in order for him to refused us boarding his taxi.
