### Name of taxi: I don't know

Today, my friend and I picked up our passports to DFA. We found a cab in Dapitan St, Sampaloc. The cab driver's name is Rizaldy, I don't know his surname. He agreed to drop us in DFA. On the way, He convinced us to make him a service all through out the trip since his house is only around bambang. So we agreed because that's nice of him. Never have we thought that taximeter is not turned on. He also got our phone numbers just to text us if he will still wait for us. After dropping us, he asked for the parking fee and for breakfast while he waits. We gave him 100php. So after the events, he dropped us in Dapitan near Sisig express. Then I asked how much is the fee for the trip. He said that it'll cost 700. Are you freaking serious? We don't have that much money. We explained that the taximeter was not even turned on. But he said, that here's the ticket. The ticket he was referring is the ticket that was already before we got there. So I humbly asking for help to take him out service because he's overcharging people. This is to think that we're still students. I cannot think that it is right to charge us 700php for that trip. And our agenda is not even that too long. It's less than hour actually. This is his phone number 09753137334.  Be aware of this kind of cab drivers. 

```Over charging, No meter```
