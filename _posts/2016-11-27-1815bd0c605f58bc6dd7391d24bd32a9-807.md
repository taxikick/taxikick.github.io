### Name of taxi: DAYRIT taxi

The taxi driver overtake a bus on a blind curve and just an inch for the taxi and our car to bump each other. And the taxi driver didn't even come down and apologize with what he did! Even have the nerve to smile and drive away! Our two girls at the back we're shocked and saddened about the incident. Kindly do not tolerate this kind of behavior!
