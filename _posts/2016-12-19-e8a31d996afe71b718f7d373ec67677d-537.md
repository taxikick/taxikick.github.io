### Name of taxi: Molnoy

I told him my destination and even the landmarks. His reply was "linawin nyo maam" with an angry accent. I was shocked coz I provided the details clearly. And otw, I told him the route I wanted to take there but he angrily refused and said "this one will take you there too". And since my destination was just near the pick up point, I was relieved coz I really wanna get down already. When we got there, I told him where the entrancebut again he angrily refused and dropped me across the road so I had to cross the road. As I was to go down, since it was in the middle of the road where he dropped me, there was already a car behind. As I was going down, he was hurrying and even had the car ran even if Im still getting out. Sigh. Thats why I never take taxis. Theres so many rude drivers. You know why drivers who do good deeds get on the news and is a big deal? Its because theyre rare. I prefer Uber and Grab coz yu can see ratings and rate the drivers for doing good or otherwise.

```Rude behavior```
