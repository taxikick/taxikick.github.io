### Name of taxi: Unknown 

The driver complained about the heavy traffic in La Trinidad since our destination was in Km 5. He even said that he will drop us off in a jeepney waiting area. I refused and he complained about the traffic and showed me a rude behavior. I am only 15 years old and I was with my friends. I felt disrespected as a passenger of taxi cabs. 

```Rude behavior```
