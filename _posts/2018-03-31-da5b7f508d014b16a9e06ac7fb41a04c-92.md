### Name of taxi: R&E

Pick up at airport. He immediately told us that minimum fixed price is 200. We bargain for 150 because the destination is near, telling him that we will just give him tip in addition to the meter charge.He told us that if we wanted for cheap transport we should opt for jeepneys or tricycle instead.  He said that since we are already inside the cab 150 pesos will do. He still turned on the meter. Meter charge is around 70.

```Over charging, Contracting```
