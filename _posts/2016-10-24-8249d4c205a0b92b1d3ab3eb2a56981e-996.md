### Name of taxi: AL-TED TAXI

Meter fare was at Php110, so I paid Php100. As I was opening the door, driver told me that my payment was not enough. I told him about the Php10 deduction. He said that there was no such thing. I asked him if he really wanted to pursue his argument, and I said the taxi plate # aloud. 

The taxi didn't leave after I closed the door. He made a U-turn and just parked a few meters from where I was standing probably just watching me. 

I tried calling the LTFRB 24/7 hotline but only hold music greeted me.

The taxi started moving again and as it passed me, driver flashed a dirty finger gesture to me. Driver made another U-turn, but I already made my way to a nearby restaurant, and told someone there about the driver. It was only then that the driver continued on his way. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
