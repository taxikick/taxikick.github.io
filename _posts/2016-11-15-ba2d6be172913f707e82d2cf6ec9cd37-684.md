### Name of taxi: Unknown

We almost got hit by the speeding taxi while we were crossing the pedestrian lane going towards Richmonde Hotel from Lourdes. We were already halfway when the taxi suddenly appeared next to us. There were no other vehicles when we crossed and the taxi just sped through Lourdes Street and abruptly turned right to San Miguel Ave. The taxi's blinkers weren't on either. No apologies from the driver whatsoever (he didn't even bother looking at us), he only got off once to check if the bumper wasn't damaged.

```Reckless driving```
