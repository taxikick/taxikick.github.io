title: UVJ219 - Lifehomes Subd., Rosario, Pasig City
---

### Name of taxi: 

From Katipunan we (2 students) entered the UVJ219 cab and instructed the driver to go to Lifehomes Subd. but he refused to go inside the subd. and only drop us off at the tricycle area which was quite a walking distance from where our home is. We agreed because we've been hailing cabs for about half an hour already and his cab was the first to agree to take us. 

Once outside the subdivision, I stated we were students while wearing our IDs and went on to pay 125 pesos (155.50-(155.50*.20) = 124.4) instead of 155.50 as stated in the meter because of the 20% discount for students, but he refused and said that the discount only applied to the elderly. I complained and he accepted a payment of 140 pesos while still not bringing us inside the subdivision.
