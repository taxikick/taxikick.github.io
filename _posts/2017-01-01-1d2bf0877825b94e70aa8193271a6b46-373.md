title: AAO6698 - NAIA Terminal 3

### Name of taxi: Macalinga Trans

Rode on this cab queueing on the regular taxi queue. He immediately drove away from the airport the moment we get in, and I noticed that he didn't start the meter. He said the trip will not be metered and will cost us 400 PHP, as the normal fare is 200 PHP going to MOA and another 200 PHP for him to go back to NAIA 3. I asked him multiple times to just drop us to the nearest unloading area or to get us back to the airport instead, but he refused. 

```Over charging, No meter```
