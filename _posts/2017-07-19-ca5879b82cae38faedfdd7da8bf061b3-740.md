### Name of taxi: N/A

We were just students trying to hire a driver on our way to house. However, this driver insisted to charge as additional 50 php caused by  "traffic" . When we were close to our destination, he tried to bargain with us. He said,  "dont look the meter; I know how far the distance is and how much it cost. It just happened that my meter is broken. The amount on the meter was 87.50php but he charge us for 160php(110 for the trip and 50 for addons) " We didnt abide on his agreement instead we gave 100php. We were waiting for our change to return but he immediately locked the door and run his car away from us.

```Refused boarding, Over charging```
