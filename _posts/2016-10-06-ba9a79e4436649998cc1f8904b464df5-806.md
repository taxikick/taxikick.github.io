### Name of taxi: JOBIT TRANS

At around 5:15pm,it was raining,we were waiting for a ride going Pasig along J.P.Rizal,when saw vacant cab JOBIT TRANS and the driver ask us that we need to add Php30 on top of the final flag down rate,we tried to ask why(?). The driver says if we dont want to pay, we just find another cab. Even we are in difficult situation,we want to understand why do we have to pay him EXTRA Php30? The driver got upset and stop in the middle of the road and forced us to GET OFF the cab in high pitch and the ask us to pay whats in the meter. We paid existing flag rate of 43.50. Even it was raining hard,we have no choice but to get off and face the heavy rain in the street.

```Over charging```
