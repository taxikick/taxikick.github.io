### Name of taxi: Jean Louise (not sure about the exact spelling)

Trip was from Blueboz Street cor. C5, going to Science Hub 4 McKinley Hills. Roughly around 1.5KM trip. It was 3:30AM so there was no heavy traffic. I normally take taxi going to work so I know trip would only cost P61.00 to P65.00. At the end of the trip, the meter read P75.00. Checking it was only 1.5KM and about 2:30 mins stop time, it should only cost P61.00. I wanted to argue but I thought the driver might retaliate. I handed him P100 and even had the guts to tell that he doesn't have coins to give me exact change, while handing me over a 20 peso bill. I checked his dashboard around and found some coins lying and saw a 10 peso coin. I handed him a 5 peso coin back.

```Tampered or broken meter, Not giving exact change```
