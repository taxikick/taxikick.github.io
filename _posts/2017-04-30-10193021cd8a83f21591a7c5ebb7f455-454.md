### Name of taxi: Vodtrasco taxi

So this driver went inside our subdivision to pick me up. On our way out, our guard-on-duty educated him about our policy that taxi drivers should leave their Identification upon going inside so that this will be documented on their log book, this will be return upon going out.

After our guard educated him, I talk to him about this matter that this should be done for security. Unfortunately, he insist of not giving it because it is a waste of his time. I told him about the convenience of reaching out directly to the driver in cases like passengers forgot their belongings. He answered me that it will be the passengers. Then i notice that there is no brand markings inside that cab, nor any details and phone number. I also notice that he doesnt have his taxi driver ID hanging. He insisted that he doesnt need one because it is a waste of money. Very, very arrogant driver. I also notice that his meter is located at his upper left side and it is not visible for passengers sitting at the back because his size will totally block the meter. So i opted to get a receipt so that I can report this matter. I tried reaching out to the LTFRB but i got no response as of this writing.
