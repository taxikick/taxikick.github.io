### Name of taxi: AARONIN & AIRA

My destination is Naia Terminal 4 (Departure Area), I tried to book a grab car but it has already been 30 mins and no available grab cars yet. So i tried to get a taxi. There's someone who is also waiting for a taxi, and when the taxi came for a halt, he asked me about my destination, as well as the other person's destination (choosy driver alert). I felt relieved when he choses me instead of the other passenger. However, once we departed going to Naia 4, the driver asked me how much am I willing to pay (huwaaat???). I told him 150, he told me 200 (wow). I reall miss uber ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
