title: GXG427 - Cebu City, Cebu

### Name of taxi: Holiday Taxi

Driver drove a longer route to get extra money, asked to "borrow" money from me that he'd "take off of meter" which wouldn't make a difference when you take an extra long route, made me feel uncomfortable asking if I had a boyfriend, moving rear-view mirror so he could see me (not back window-totally unsafe). I'm a pretty considerate person so I know when to draw the line between kind compliments and creepy. Definitely not a safe driver for 1 lone young (I'm 17) female passenger, wouldn't want him to treat another the same.
