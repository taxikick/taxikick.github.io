### Name of taxi: I cannot remember exactly the name of the taxi.

From Tektite Bldg. to Valle Verde 1 it only takes 10 minutes and or maybe 30 mins but that is the worst scenario and has 1% chance of happening. I know it's too close but it was too hot so I decided to hail a cab. But this driver rejected me and said it's traffic. Hello, since when didn't we have traffic in Manila? Excuses...

```Refused boarding```
