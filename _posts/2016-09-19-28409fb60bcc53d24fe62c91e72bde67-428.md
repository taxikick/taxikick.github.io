### Name of taxi: Wasn't able to get

I was lining up in the taxi queue at Pacific Mall. This taxi came up and dropped a passenger. Since it was my turn in the line, I got in and told him of my destination - Brgy. Casili. He rudely refused me, saying he does not want to go there. So I just told him to drop me of at the corner going to Canduman, which is very near Pacific Mall already. He again rudely said to me he isn't going there. He did not even give me a reason why. It was just after lunch too when he refused. 

```Refused boarding```
