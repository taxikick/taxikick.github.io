### Name of taxi: Emerson

The driver claimed that he did not have enough money to give the change. My mother did not have the exact amount of money on the meter so we ended up letting the driver keep the change. The driver was also parked in a busy street so if we argued and insisted, we would have held up traffic.

```No receipt, Not giving exact change```
