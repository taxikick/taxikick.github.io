title: UYC489 - NAIA Terminal 1 Arrival Area, Metered taxi waiting area
---

### Name of taxi: UDPS or DPS

This transpired last March 20, 2018 around 8:48 PM.Me and my wife just came from vacation abroad and alight on the plane via NAIA terminal 1. At the arrival area we went straight to the metered taxi booth and the dispatcher gave us a taxi security slip which includes the infos of the said taxis.By the way we will be going only to Edsa Taft MRT from NAIA terminal 1. Then when we already left Terminal 1, i noticed that the taxi meter is off. i asked him , "kuya naka metered tayo diba po?" and he replied "opo,metered po tayo"..then after a few meters of driving again i asked again "kuya diba po naka metered tayo? bat po naka-off yung metro? " . Then he showed me a card which said domestic- PHP 600.00/ passenger. So meaning to say from NAIA terminal 1 to MRT taft we need to pay him PHP 1,200.00. I asked the driver to just drop us to the taxicab waiting nearby. By the way the taxi's name is i think UDPS or if not DPS and the taxi driver's name is Ardi, Ente or Emte. My apology, because the details at the taxi slip given by NAIA dispatcher's handwriten was not really cleared.
