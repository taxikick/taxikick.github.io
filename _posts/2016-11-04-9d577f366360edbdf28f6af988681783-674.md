title: UVC661 - GMA Kamuning
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

As soon as I hopped in and got settled I asked about his meter. He said GMA isn't that far. I let him cos I shouldn't have to argue about it. But I resolved to give him 50 pesos cos 8 out of 10 times, it's how much it costs from Q. Ave. He said I should give him more. I refused cos it's his fault he didn't use the meter. And then he rudely said, "bahala ka."

```No meter, Rude behavior```
