### Name of taxi: louiegrace

it happened last sat about 7pm, this choosy driver offered his taxi but wanted to have an addtl 50 pesos bcoz accrdng to him,it is rush hour and very traffic and es we agreed to addtl 50..not knowing that he did not flagged down the meter of his taxi..and we also didnt notice since were tired and all we wanted is to go home..
until we reach zabarte road and  we notice his meter and i ask him about it..what he did is he stop and told us to go down..i ask why? i am only asking how much would i pay him since he didnt flagged his meter down.he shouted 'u have to pay me 170 bcoz that what we agreed upon..i told the driver....u told us to add 50 to the meter rate...and he keeps on telling me 'magulang k pla,bumaba ka...so bumaba. n lng kmi ng anak ko and i pay him 70..kc in lng dapat ang rate nun
