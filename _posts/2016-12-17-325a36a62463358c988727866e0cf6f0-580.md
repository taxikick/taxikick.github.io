### Name of taxi: Unknown

While waiting for almost 30 mins of trying to catch a taxi, there were numerous taxis that refused as well but this is one of them that I caught that I thought was a perfect example of choosing passingers and refusing others. We said our destination to the driver and he guessed for about a minute and said "Traffic daw, pero magkano daw. Nag tanong din yung kasama ko "bakit? Wala ka bang metro" yung sagot is "traffic daw".
