### Name of taxi: Southland taxi

I hailed a taxi at around 5:30pm in Dapitan street,near Jollibee corner Lacson Street.I was about to board the taxi but it was locked. I tried opening the the front door but, he instead open the window, not the door. He asked me for my destinatiion and told him that it's in Otis, Paco,Manila. He refused to board me and rushed forward as if I was not a passenger. I was heading home that time beccause I was tired from my classes in UST. In this abusive treatment, I need help and assitance especially to the concerned Governemnt Agency at hand. May There be Light that would shed in this dark experience.
