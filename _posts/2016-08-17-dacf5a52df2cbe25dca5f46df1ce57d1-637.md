title: TXY525 - España Road nearing Welcome Rotunda

### Name of taxi: M.G.E

Well I am actually not a passenger but I was someone who has been bumped by this taxi at the back of my car. Yes it might be small but it is still needed to be painted and fixed. The driver of the unit seriously do have a very bad attitude. He was the one who bumped me from behind and he even tried to raise his voice against me and my friend. My car is staying still in front of him and he bumped me . After that I immediately went outside to check if there is a damage and it was a bit negligible so I haven't asked for any money or compensation for it. What I cannot stand is his rude attitude and behavior, before the accident happened I came to saw him while on traffic using his phone and wearing no seat belts at all, and I am pretty sure he is driving recklessly swerving and driving fast even though it was kinda congested in España that time (around 8-9 PM). The road was also wet due to rain showers. I wasn't actually sure about the Taxi name since I wasn't really able to get a good look because I was sick and it's still raining a bit.

```Rude behavior, Not in uniform```
