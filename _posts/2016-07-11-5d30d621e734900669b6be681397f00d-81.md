### Name of taxi: EFCAJAYCOR TAXI

Driver asked which route we wanted to take. Told him Makati Ave then Kalayaan, as per Waze. As usual, traffic was real bad. It was rush hour. Driver became rude and kept talking about how he shouldn't have asked me. He was really pissed because of the heavy traffic but he was ranting endlessly. At one point at a pedestrian, he open his window and cursed on the people repeatedly. He kept on ranting and cursing on the way. We wanted to get out but we were scared he's gonna shout at us or worse.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
