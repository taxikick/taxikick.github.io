title: AWD298 - MOA to NAIA Terminal 3
---

### Name of taxi: Not applicable 

Was about to get UBER but taxi was right in front of us so my mom and I decided to use it instead.  We didn't get the name of the driver, who was a dark moreno middle-aged man, had black sunglasses and black gloves. We told him we were going to NAIA Terminal 3 and he gave us two choices, one was the skyway, which he asked us to add 45 pesos. But we opted to the second choice. It seemed that he was annoyed by that decision. The car smelled like light BO. There was light traffic on the road. He uttered sounds of frustration each time we had to stop but we thought that was normal. But on our destination, he was clearly annoyed and started yelling which bay we were in instead of asking us nicely and respectfully. When paid, he didn't return our change. He drove off afterward. But i took a good look at his plate number and wrote it down on my phone. We are not locals and our flight was just an hour away so we didn't have time to report him. But i found this website and i hope that the authorities will take a look at this incident.
