title: AAO7462 - NAIA Airport

### Name of taxi: Naning

It was in NAIA Airport when it happened. The location will be in Litex and I told the driver to use the route from Quezon Blvd. The driver refused and said that it is traffic and we need to take the route in Edsa. However, when we are currently in Edsa, it is also traffic. I was disappointed because the driver refused what I said to him and it takes almost 3 hours to arrive in Litex.
