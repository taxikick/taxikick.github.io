### Name of taxi: Herlet Joy

10:28pm I’m trying to get back home. Took a while to get a cab, and UBER/GRAB seemed to be experiencing delays. I told the driver I’m heading to Project 7 (near SM North EDSA). Right off the bat he said “Pwede bang 200 doon?” I smiled sourly and said, sure, but at the back of my mind I intended to report this driver. As it turns out, Traffic along EDSA was light, and I managed to get home in less than 20 minutes. That ride could have been only around 120 pesos if he turned the meter on.
