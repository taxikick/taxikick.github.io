### Name of taxi: LBR

My fare was 71.50. I gave him 100 and he gave me 25 and in a rude voice said, "okay na ba yan?". I offered 2 pesos and asked for 5 pesos to make my change 18 pesos. He asked for the 5 pesos back and I thought he would give me 10pesos. I kept apologizing because I got confused.  In the end he gave me back the 5pesos and very rudely said, "Kulang ako ng 3.50! Okay na ba yan!" I said I need it for tryk fare but he just kept being rude so I just left. 

```Rude behavior, Not giving exact change```
