### Name of taxi: Not sure, but I got it from grab taxi

The driver asked for additional fee asside from the 50php fee for grab. Also, the total taxi meter charge when i arrived at home was 713php. There's obviously something wrong with his meter. Even the grab app calculated the fare to be around 362 to 544php only(I have screenshot). So all in all i paid more than 800php, from naia t2 to masinag area. Driver's name is Antionio Santiago Sauza. I'm pretty sure there' a "magic" with his meter

```Over charging```
