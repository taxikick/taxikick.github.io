title: UVP880 - ES Transport Bus Terminal Cubao
---

### Name of taxi: CELYNN

Boarded taxi along Shaw Blvd. Driver asked for additional P30 for fast transport to my destination, ES Transport Bus Terminal in Cubao. When I refused, I noticed that driver intentionally slowed down the travel. Asked him specifically to pass the Cubao underpass. When we got to that area, driver again intentionally did not use the underpass but instead went to the area of Farmers. When I reached my destination in the bus terminal in Cubao, taxi meter read P134.50. I handed him P125 because of the "less P10 policy" on taxi fares. At the terminal, I rode a bus bound for Bulacan and when I was seated, I saw the driver come up the bus and approach me. He angrily demanded for the payment of "exact fare", meaning an additional P10. He got into a discussion with me and reasoned out that gas prices have increased so he wanted the additional fare. I still refused to give him the additional P10. After about a minute of ranting, the driver turned to leave, and I heard him mumble, "gago" while he was walking down the aisle of the bus. He then rode his cab and left.
