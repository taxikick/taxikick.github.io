### Name of taxi: M. Carlo (?) not sure

After his passenger alighted, me & my friend rode. Driver then asked where to. I said we're headed to IPI. He said that since he's Grab (taxi), we need to pay an extra PhP 50. I said I didn't even use my app to hire him. He refused us because we won't pay him extra. I asked if there's a new rule with Grab that they can't accommodate non-Grab users anymore, & he said none. Still, he refused to give us a ride. Very rude & greedy!
