title: UVC564 - Taxi stand of SM City Sucat
---

### Name of taxi: ERA

At around 1:30 PM, me and my family just finished our lunch because it was Father's Day, we were waiting in line in the taxi stand of SM City Sucat. There was a long queue waiting but only one taxi that was being loaded. After a few minutes, an ERA taxi arrived and the driver was shouting " san kayo?" then the one infront of the line said "Tambo", the taxi driver answered "ay hindi, pa Las Piñas ako, sino dyan ang Las Piñas?" Then I started taking video of the incident and told the driver of the taxi "kuya bawal yan, namimili ka ng pasahero" then the driver said, "ano yan pinipicturan mo ako, sige picturan mo ako". I told him "hindi kuya video ito papadala ko kay Duterte" then he curse me and speed away.
