### Name of taxi: E.S VILLEGAS

Initially , taxi driver asked me to add 'plus 60 ' because it is traffic . I said , pasensya na po dami KO na din gastos sa pamasahe today (in  very polite way) , he insisted" may resibo naman , company naman yan diba? " then u said, "kuya wala po ako work" .. Then as we love along Jupiter he said" mag grab ka na lang , papunta kasi ako Pasay , Maiipit ako sa traffic, maraming taxi dyan " then I said, "hinindian Ko lang po yung plus 60 ninyo ,ibababa niyo na ako?" .. then he kept insisting , and I  begged him not to as I am also in a rush for my doctir appointment ..then I kept quiet .. As of the end of this writing , We are already in BGC , traffic is not that bad, :( anyways, I was hoping yo get details bit He doesn't have his taxi ID hanging .. I just got his plate number 
ATA1481 ..
