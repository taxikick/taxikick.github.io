### Name of taxi: Unknown

I usually accompany my gf on her way to ride a taxi and the one to call taxis for her. That morning i hailed a taxi around 4:30am-5am and the above mentioned taxi stopped. With my gf running late for her work immediately rode the taxi without hesitation. After the taxi left my gf texted me that the driver is asking for 100 pesos on a trip that usually only takes 60-65 pesos only. So i texted her to get the taxi's plate number and driver name. She only got the plate number because there were no details of who the driver is that can be seen.
