title: TYP691 - We came from Cubao to Midtown Village at Cainta

### Name of taxi: Mge

We came from Cubao to Cainta. Our bill was just 155. Then when I gave my money (500), he asked for extra charge. I was shocked then asked him how much will he charge us? He said, 200. I was wondering why he should ask for extra charge because it was not rush hour during that time. It's already past 12 in the morning. We didn't encountered any hassle. he should told us in the first place that there will be an extra charge! I am really pissed about what happened. I just hope that there will be an immediate action regarding this matter. 

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
