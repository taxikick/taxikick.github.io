### Name of taxi: Melber Taxi

Taxi driver: Ariel Galang Discallar.     

A few minutes after we left Manila Hotel, he informed me that I have to add 50 pesos to the meter fare because it was traffic. At Roxas Blvd., he stopped at the side of the road at a cart and shouted to the vendor to sell him coffee because he was sleepy. We waited for the vendor to understand what he wanted, mix his coffee and for him to pay for it, all of  which took about 10 minutes. When we reached Hotel 101, he charged me 200 pesos when the fare in the meter was 141 pesos.

```Over charging, No receipt```
