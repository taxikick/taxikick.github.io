### Name of taxi: Hajimi taxi

The taxi driver is blaming me for the instruction of place that he didn't understand. I clearly stated the exact place and he said . "ok". It is also already annoyed when I 'm asking if he could drop me at a few meters earlier. Then when I ask for the change he even stated that he already provided the receipt so there will be no change. But I insisted even for a smaller amount but he only gave 5 pesos.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
