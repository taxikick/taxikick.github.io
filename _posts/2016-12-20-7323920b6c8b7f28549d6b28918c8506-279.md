### Name of taxi: Mega

This happened around 8PM. I was with my babysitter, brother, and sister, and my 2 year old son and 1 year old niece. He refused to board because he claims that the kids cannot ride his taxi. I wasn't okay with it but I cannot force him. So I told him to just go. But then he didn't leave. He started murmuring and talking about rules and regulations. It's a fact that taxi drivers choose their passengers but at least don't be rude. Taxi drivers really need to improve their service. Because right now, for me it's better to take GrabCar.

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
