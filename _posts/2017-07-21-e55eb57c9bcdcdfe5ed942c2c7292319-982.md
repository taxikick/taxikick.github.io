### Name of taxi: Unknown

I feel bad about reporting this because the driver is old and still working, might mean he needs the job badly. But for the safety of pedestrians, other drivers, and his own passenger. I think this driver shouldn't drive anymore. :( He almost hit a student on the sidewalk, if I hadn't called his attention. Many times throughout the trip he would go over the midline, even if there was oncoming traffic. And he stalled in the middle of the road a number of times. Sometimes he drove super slow because I felt like he couldn't see that well anymore. Cguro due to old age. I didn't catch his name kasi walang ID sa dashboard, but I just got the plate num.
