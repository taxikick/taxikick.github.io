### Name of taxi: Unknown

He refuel for more than 5 minutes which made our rate jumped from P57 to P78.50 but when I raised the matter to him he started to rude and sooner became mad. I asked him to stop the cab and when we're out, I took a picture of his taxi and suddenly he attempted to drive the car intentionally while I'm at the front of his car.

```Rude behavior, Out of line```
