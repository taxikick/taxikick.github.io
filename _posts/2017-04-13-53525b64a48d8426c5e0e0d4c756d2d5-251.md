### Name of taxi: M.G.E

 We were both on a cab my girlfriend and I. She usually go to trips like this in my house and then in hers so that she'll know I'm safe. But then the meter was way too high than the regular most times we were only charge 300 from cainta back to marikina but it was going way to high. She's still on the cab that's going up to 600+! It was totally tampered. The driver kept on looking at the meter like all the  time. I hope he hears about this and quit using that meter. 

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
