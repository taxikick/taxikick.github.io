### Name of taxi: RDJW

First of all refused meter then our hotel helped and he agreed. We then got to the airport. Doors locked, demanded 600p where we took the exact same journey a few days earlier and paid 160p on the meter. 2 young girls being locked in a car and demanded money was incredibly scary! Luckily there was a airport security officer who could see our distress and helped. 

```Over charging, No meter```
