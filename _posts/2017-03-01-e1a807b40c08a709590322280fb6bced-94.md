### Name of taxi: Our Lady Of Piat

My friend and I hailed a cab near Conrad's Grille Pasay going to Multinational Village at around 7:30pm. The driver kept on cursing and ranting about his previous passenger that made him really angry. We were already approaching the stoplight in Park & Fly Building when he suddenly took his knife/long sharp object, pointed it to us and told us, "Pag kayo tinamaan nito, malas niyo!". Thank you God we had a chance to run right away from that crazy taxi driver!
