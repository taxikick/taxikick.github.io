title: UIJ756 - Buting Kalayaan C5
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

When we (me and my husband) are already inside the car we have asked to pay 150php from Buting Kalayaan to McKinley Hill Taguig. Should only be few minutes from Buting. We asked the driver to just use the meter but he refused and asked as to get out of the car. Very rude.
