title: UVH331 - ROB ERMITA-BUTING
---

### Name of taxi: 

I want to report an incident about this taxi, It might possibly have a tampered meter and it caused me around Php370 from Ermita to Buting at 4pm thursday afternoon. Normally. It would only take me Php 200-300 max if is really traffic. But moderate traffic and it only took me an hour. But it drastically doubled the fare. By chance. I get to look at the meter and it changes by Php 7.00  per shift which normally should be Php 3.50. I asked the driver and he did not answer. Also. He keeps on pretending to be a mad bu saying foul words just so I wont bother to as him again. Anyway. I want the meter of this taxi if possible be checked. Thank you
