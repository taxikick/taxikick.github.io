### Name of taxi: N/A

IF YOU SEE THIS TAXI PLEASE REPORT IMMEDIATELY. This car has all markings of an taxi outside but in the inside it doesn't have any details. The No smoking in public vehicles signs was obviously self-made and fake and no taxi driver's identification form displayed.  And the mostly creepiest thing is he doesn't have a rear view mirror. This taxi is a modus for kidnappings or holdap. He kept on asking personal questions at first. Then when i felt creeped out so i told him to let me down at kfc (not where i was going) he ask me "bakit" he followed with "akala ko sa (insert destination here) ka?" then i just came up with an excuse that i needed to eat. He didn't even have change but i really did not bother getting it anyways i just wanted to get out of that car. STAY SAFE EVERYONE
