### Name of taxi: ENVIROCAB

The driver don't used the taxi meter and wants us to pay 100 pesos from malate (pan pacific) to vito cruz, taft. Its okay to pay 100 or more than if he used his meter. I asked he to stop the taxi but he never did. he kept saying "100 na nga lang oh. tatlo na kayo. nakuha ko na kayo eh". I told him that I am going to report him but still HE DID NOT STOP DRIVING. My friends are a bit scared, so i stopped complaining while on the road. 

```No meter```
