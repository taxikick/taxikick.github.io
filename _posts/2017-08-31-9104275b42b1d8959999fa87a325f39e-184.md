### Name of taxi: Not sure

Driver quoted us a flat rate to destination.  Seemed fair given traffic for area.  When we get there and get money to pay he sees us with money and proceeds to ask almost double.  Tell him no.  We even added extra for tip and he didnt like it.  Tried to tell us traffic was bad.  Told him it always is in area and he should know that.  Starts getting upset and trying to force us to pay.  Have to keep telling him no and he keeps getting more angry and rude to us.  Tells us to stop talking and just give him the money. 

```Over charging, No meter```
