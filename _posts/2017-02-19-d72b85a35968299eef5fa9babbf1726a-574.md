### Name of taxi: Not checked

I did not noticed that he did not turn the meter on. When he dropped me off, he said 500 pesos. I asked him why it's too much coz grab charged me 170 only(I gave tip of course). He answered, "malayo kasi". I told him na sana, he turned the meter on para walangproblema. He then said na 300 nalang. I gave him 200 and grabbed my cell phone, took a picture of his plate number. He drove fast to leave to area coz people are coming when they heard my voice and there was a security guard in the scene. 


```Over charging```
