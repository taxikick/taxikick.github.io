title: UWJ333 - From santol corner to sm manila
---

### Name of taxi: 

I boarded on santol st., corner magsaysay blvd this morning june 20, 2016. I told him i need to go to resorts world manila. He affirmed and went on. I also told him if we can drop by an atm since i don't have cash on hand. He didn't took the nagtahan route but instead went straight to the bridge going to mendiola. Upon descending the bridge i noticed his metered not yet set to hired. It has already been around 20 mins after i boarded. He said that it will only just be 400 so there's nothing to worry. First of all, i didn't agreed to any verbal contract with him. Second, 400 pesos from sampaloc to resorts world is just around 200 pesos. Plus, the route he is taking is in hwavy traffic. When we reached sm manila, i just told him i need to withdraw money, but i walked away instead. I'm at fault also but charging me twice the normal fare i pay everyday is highway ripoff. Please be aware of this taxi. UWJ 333
