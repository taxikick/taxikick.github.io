### Name of taxi: Indescribable Gift

We took a taxi from Venice Plaza in Mckinley to C5 staff house. Upon boarding the taxi I told the driver the destination is staff house, upon arriving at C5 staff house I told the driver that we will drop off on the side of the road near the habal-habal area in Staff house. The driver was rude and angry, saying he's going to take a long U-turn because we dropped off on that area. I immediately gave the fare and he even banged his hand on the taxi's dashboard to show he's discontent. 

```Rude behavior```
