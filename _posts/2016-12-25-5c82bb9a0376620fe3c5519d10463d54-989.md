### Name of taxi: Colorum

When we got into the taxi and told the driver our destination he refused because he said the route was too narrow for him to pass through even though it was passable in reality... The road was one way and theres just no excuse for him to refuse us because the route wasnt even that far and traffic to the route was minimal and it was my first time in in iloilo to have a taxi refuse to take us to that said destination which is in the city proper its not even that far...
