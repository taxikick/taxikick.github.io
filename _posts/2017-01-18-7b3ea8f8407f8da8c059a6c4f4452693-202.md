### Name of taxi: i dont know

I rode the taxi at around 5:35 AM going to Eastwood Libis. Taxi Driver ASSUREDme that he has a receipt. I need the receipt to reimburse to the company. NO Receipt NO Reimbursement policy applies. I got irritated and  scolded him. I wasn't able to look back to check my belongings.  Due to anger my phone slipped on my pouch. I tried to ring my phone but now it's unattended. My phone is not a smart phone, but it has all my personal details and I'm afraid this will be an incident of identity theft in the future. 

```No receipt, Left behind items```
