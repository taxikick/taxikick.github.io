### Name of taxi: KEN-NOL

He is telling that he asked for additonal charge. But he did not mention clearly from the start. He mentioned only flag down as I know it is the standard flagdown of only php40.  But then he did not give my change . The meter is only php117 and I gave php150.

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
