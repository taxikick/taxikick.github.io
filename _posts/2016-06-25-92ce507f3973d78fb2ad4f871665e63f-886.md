### Name of taxi: 

I came out the cab and paid 80 (bill at 78.50). I hurriedly entered the bldg because my shifts starts at 11pm. Then a lady called me and pointed to the taxi driver. I came back to check what happened, this manong taxi driver showed me the meter at 82. He said that he already erased the receipt and wanted me to pay 2php more. I asked him about the 10php roll back. He answered me in high tone. He is shouting at me saying that it's no longer applicable. I told him not shout and i gave 20php. Im asking for my change (driver continously talking and shouting) and he gave me 10php. I told him to stop yelling cos i already gave what he demanded.

I wanted to confirm the 10php roll back and want this driver punished. They should teach him a lesson so he would know how to talk to his customers politely. Also, teach him to count 123 'cos he doesnt even know how to give the correct change.  Rude and overcharging taxi drivers should be punished. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
