### Name of taxi: Angel Mars

A cab home normally priced at around P70 but this taxi hiked up to double the usual amount. P140! The taxi didn't also have a good working AC. Lastly, it even cost more than Grab.  This driver should be apprehended. If not, hoping karma would do its job soon. Tsk.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
