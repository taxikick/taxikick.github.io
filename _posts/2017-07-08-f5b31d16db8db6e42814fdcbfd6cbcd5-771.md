### Name of taxi: E.J. Dela Cruz

Not exactly rude, just dont have options for sleeping drivers. I rode this taxi from adriatico to SM Moa but he brought me to traffic streets just to sleep while in traffc. Even if the traffic light is on GO, we are not moving because he is sleeping.

```Rude behavior```
