title: NIV799 - Mall of Asia
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

I hailed that generic white taxi from Espa√±a (near UST) for the soul purpose of going to Mall of Asia. Then the driver told us right away that "It's traffic, maybe you could give plus 50." Now usually I'd go out of the taxi right away, but seeing as I was a bit tired I just accepted it. Bad choice. The driver WENT TO THE MOST TRAFFIC PARTS OF MANILA, just to have extra money. I live here, so I know that was intentional. Instead of going just straight to baywalk (which I feel there were no so called 'traffic' or it isn't THAT worse), he proceeded to go to places where there are traffic. I left my house 5pm, and we arrived to moa at 7!! Sweet mother of God, if he had taken the route to baywalk at least we'd arrived 6pm! That's not all. A friend of mine was with me at the time and he left his cellphone there, (totally unresellable but he keeps it still for contacts) and I tried calling it (the taxi hadn't even been gone THAT long, just a few minutes. But wow, driver isn't answering the call!! If he thinks he can sell it then goodluck, that phone is BEYOND irresselable, it had huge cracks on the phone itself.
