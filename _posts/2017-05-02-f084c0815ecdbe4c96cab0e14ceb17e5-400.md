### Name of taxi: Unknown

We came from the shell recidences near moa and our destination is to SMX convention center. We noticed that the taxi driver did not turn his meter on as to determine how much we are going to pay for our trip. upon disembarking, he told us to pay a fixed rate 100 pesos which is a little bit overpriced. One of my friends told the driver that yesterday, she was only charged 60pesos with the same origin and destination. But the driver still insisted about the fixed rate. we were very disappointed how the driver treated us. We are from davao city. I hope that upon raising our concern, it will also help other taxi drivers to be aware that what this driver did to us was wrong.

```Over charging, No meter```
