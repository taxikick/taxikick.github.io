### Name of taxi: ADVICAN

I ask the driver to drop me to BAYANI road Afpovai he reply in a rude manner telling me Sa highway Lang Ba yan? And I said opo. Then he turn to the right on the way to c5 and I told him pwede nmn po kumaliwa Sa gilid because I don't want Sa c5 dumadaan especially pag gabi po. Then he insist in a rude manner Hindi mo Ba nakikita Na bawal dun that was he said to me. And I stayed quiet Kahit I know Na pwede nmn dun kumaliwa kasi taga the fort po ako Alam ko yung bawal Na area Sa Hindi. When I said para po Sa Tabi along BAYANI road near the gasoline station where he drop me off I gave 100 pesos and my bill is 106.50 he look waiting still dahil kulang yung bayad ko but I told him diba Manong minus 10pesos pa nmn po Kaya I didn't give the 6.50 and he said angrily nakakainis ka talaga and I said bakit po and he said Hindi ikaw Ang kausap ko. (E kaming dalawa Lang nmn po Ang Tao Sa taxi) and me trying to explain y I didn't give yung kulang Na 6.50 then he said eto bigay ko sayo yung 4 pesos Na sukli and I said no need Na po Manong he was angry at me and I told him Manong God bless you po. And banged the door. I almost cried po kasi first time ko po mag salita Ng ganun at matakot po ako Sa kanya.He was so rude Na dapat he is nice Sa passengers. I don't do this mag report pero I believe I need to do this para maturuan Ng good manners mga taxi drivers po. Sana mag karoon Ng seminar ang mga taxi drivers before po sila I hire.
