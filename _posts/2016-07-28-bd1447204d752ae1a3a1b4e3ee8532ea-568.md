title: TVQ3Q4 - Coronado st mandaluyong city
---

### Name of taxi: 

My sister and i was at divisoria ... We couldnt stand the heat it was around 3 pm so we decided to grab a cab instead of riding a jeepney. Our destination is at coronado st mandaluyong city its near the old bridge of mandaluyong and makati, at first it was going good but when we get to kalentong he started ranting that its too far we should pay 400+  Blahblah but we just let him talk. The meter only says 170+ anyway. Arriving on the destination the meter says 229 pesos and my sister was nice enough to give him extra ... She gave him 500 pesos and was asking for 175 so he can have the rest 325 ... But he was so mad he only gave my sister 120 ... My sister told him to give her what she ask but he's being arrogant and rude to us he told us to get out because its causing a traffic, my sister wishes him goodluck then we left. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
