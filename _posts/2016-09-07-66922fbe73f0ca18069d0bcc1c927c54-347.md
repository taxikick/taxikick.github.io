title: UVC931 - The trip started in Morayta going to Trinoma
---

### Name of taxi: I don't know

The taxi is in morayta and he is also a grab driver. We left at morayta at around 6:10 in the evening and we arrived at trinoma mall at around 8:00. He keeps on saying "traffic" even though it is not that traffic at sto. domingo church but he keeps on staying at the lane that is traffic. We are near at the stop light in DELTA and we thought that he will turn to west avenue which is more less traffic but instead of turning he go straight to quezon avenue which is more traffic. and as we arrived at trinoma mall the bill in the meter was 170+ pesos and i pay him 200 pesos. Instead of giving us change he ask for additional 20 pesos because he says that we grab him. We did not arrived at our expected time because of what he did.
