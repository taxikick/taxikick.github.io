### Name of taxi: Can't remember

We took a cab to take us to the south terminal, and the driver took a different route even when there was a shorter and faster route. He even made a comment about the cost of illegal drugs, which was completely off-topic. When we reached our destination and I asked how much our fare was, he tried his best to not show us the taxi meter and suggested a specific amount. 

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
