title: UWG290 - UST TO MANDALUYONG
---

### Name of taxi: mehrdad

My trip from ust to mandaluyong usually took me about less than 150 pesos when its Saturday. We are at stop and shop old sta. mesa when i looked at the meter I was shocked when i saw that the meter is already P120.50. its too high already. usually it is only P80.00 then when the route is clear and the driver is speeding up i saw that the meter charge added 3.50 pesos then 10 seconds later it added another 3.50 pesos. in short, the meter charge were doubled in less than a minute. i think the driver were using something that can speed or doubled the meter charge. My total fare when i arrived was P204.50. P50-60 higher than my usual rate. So my grandfather ask if we get 20% discount because he is already a senior but the driver refuses to answer.
