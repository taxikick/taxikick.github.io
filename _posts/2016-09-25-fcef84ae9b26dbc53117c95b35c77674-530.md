### Name of taxi: forgot

At first when i just got into his taxi, he drove his way quickly. I then noticed why is that there are no meter, he then told me that taxi drivers normally don't have their meters at dawn. It was 2:40's am that time when he just drove and abide the traffic rules. When we got to my destination, i paid him 100. I was waiting for the change, I then asked for a change. But he got mad, we quarrelled . But I realized it won't end well. I'd rather report here than get hurt.

```Over charging, No meter```
