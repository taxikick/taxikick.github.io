### Name of taxi: R.M. Giron

I was trying to hail a cab heading towards Cubao, he was the 5th taxi I tried to hailed that said that they are about to get home and that they can't take me to Cubao, unless if I was heading to Valenzuela.  They are only taking in passengers heading their way.    I just got pissed off to this 5th Taxi that has that same reason, he took me in, but when I told him where I am heading into, he started to say that I cannot take you there because I am already home.  And that he thought I was heading to Valenzuela.  He said that he can be picky if it is garage time already.  And that is when this argument took place.  I paste here the link of my video as my evidence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul2fpX5Eb3M
