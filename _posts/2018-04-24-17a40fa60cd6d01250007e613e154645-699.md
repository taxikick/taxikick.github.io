### Name of taxi: Unknown

While giving the destination the driver repeatedly told me that his clutch was broken... when I got off the taxi he got a different passenger going a different location. He even told me to drive the taxi for me to see the clutch is broken. True or not its not right to pick passengers or to put their lives at risk.
