title: TXW932 - After global city, when cars are exiting left
---

### Name of taxi: Padrino Taxi

A car infront of him is giving his way for us cars that are going left to collide with their line and this taxi driver is honking his horns against the car that is giving way for us and then when the car move away in order to give wayfor the taxi because his honking and honking his horns against the car, he started to drive towards me since im the last car that the good car had given his way. Even though im already inside the line, he keeps on pushing me to go out of his way, our side mirrors had been damaged if i havent moved right. But still, even if he has enough space already he keeps on going. He doesnt care about his or my car getting damages. I captured a photo of him, and he ran over us and i shouted at him and then he's saying rude words as if he didnt do anything, and then he spitted on my car but he was unsuccessful because the wind just took it back at him (karma is a bitch they say) and then he started to get his gun beside him so we drove off and then he wanted to run over us again until we have gotten to the point that he needed to turn right. 

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
