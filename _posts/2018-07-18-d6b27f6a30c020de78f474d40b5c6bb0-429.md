title: GXR632 - Castle Peak Mabolo, Cebu City

### Name of taxi: Yoo Taxi

I was already inside the taxi. He asked me where I'll be going. When I told him that I'm going to SM, he asked me to get another taxi because according to him, Castle Peak called him to pick up a passenger. I told him that I was the one who got in the taxi first. He still rudely asked me to get out of the taxi
