### Name of taxi: WASN'T ABLE TO GET TAXI NAME

I was waiting for a taxi from Parola, Cainta, Rizal going to Palmera 2, Taytay, Rizal near Tikling. This taxi stopped and let me board. As soon as I got in the cab, he said "magkano po ba binabayad niyo papunta dun" and I just said "metro nalang po kuya". He kept on insisting that he will not get any passengers going back but where I live, there are a lot of people going to work, etc. and it was raining. When we got to Junction in Cainta, he asked me again, dagdag nalang tayo ah kasi wla ako makukuha pasahero palabas. I said bahala na po. He said, province na kasi yan eh. And we got into an argument. I mean we are also coming from a province going to a province. Then finally, he said, baba nalang kayo dito wala naman pala dagdag.
