### Name of taxi: I don't knoe

We were halfway crossing the pedestrian lane at university avenue when a taxi was approaching the pedestrian lane and it was still running really fast. I raised my hands just to give a sign that means 'hey, this is a pedestrian lane. You should slow down.' However, the driver did not slow down and I saw that he also raised his two hands while driving. This driver does not deserve my respect because he does not respect people who cross the pedestrian lanes.
