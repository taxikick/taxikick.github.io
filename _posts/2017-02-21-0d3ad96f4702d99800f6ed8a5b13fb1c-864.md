### Name of taxi: i forgot but the color of the taxi is white and the name of the taxi on the top of the car is color red and its quite unfamiliar

He was so creepy hes like talking to someone over the phone but i think he was just pretending. he looks drunk and drugged. and starting to ask creepy questions like "maam gusto mo itanan kita"
