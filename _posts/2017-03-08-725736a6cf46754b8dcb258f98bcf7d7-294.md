### Name of taxi: Unknown

The driver of this taxi is hostile. While driving in my lane, he tried to cut into it which almost resulted to a collision, but I was the one who was able to control the lane. Afterwards the driver was the aggressor, he made sure that I couldnt pass him after he was ahead since his lane moved first than ours. He tried to initiate a collision by stopping abruptly in the middle of a fast lane ahead of me which almost resulted to another collision. And then he tried to cut into my lane when I was in another lane; it was such a close call that I had to step hard on my brakes which activated the car's ABS. That got the best of me. Binabaan ko na sya nung traffic and knocked on his driver side window para magusap kami pero ayaw na hanggang naabutan na kami ng green light. This driver should lose his license kasi mapapaaway lang sya. May madadamay pa na ibang motorista sa kagaguhan nya. Baka mapatay pa siya pano na lang pamilya nya. Seems madami na din nagreklamo sa taxi na ito in this site.
