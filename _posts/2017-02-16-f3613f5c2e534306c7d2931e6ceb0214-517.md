title: AAK7301 - One Archer's Place in Taft, Taxi was hailed from Russia Street in Better Living but obviously wasn't from there
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Asked for +50. I obliged because I would anyway, it was getting late and I needed to go home. Once we arrived at the destination, immediately pressed the button on the meter, hiding the fare and asking for 300 (I usually only pay 250, and I think I glanced the price to be at around 160-something before he pressed a button to hide the price). Also, the taxi sped recklessly through tight traffic and was texting while driving.
