### Name of taxi: N/A

There weren't any jeeps operating at 12mn to Poblacion, so I opted to take a cab. The driver agreed to take me to Rockwell, but suddenly proposed P150 as my fare. "Pamasko lang, Ma'am." I refused, and insisted that he open his meter. He made me leave at a dark, secluded area in EDSA, and I noticed that he didn't leave (parang akala magbabago ang isip ko at kakagat ako sa 150). When I finally got a cab, the fare was only P50.50.

```Over charging, No meter```
