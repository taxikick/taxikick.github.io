### Name of taxi: BianCaye Transport

We were trying to choose a taxi because we are carrying a special passenger and could not go for an old taxi which was on the line. The driver then spoke to us in a super rude manner with a loud voice and prevented us from boarding. Such bad manners from a driver. The taxi is also a colorum, has the "Matatag na Republika" plate instead of the yellow issued ones.
