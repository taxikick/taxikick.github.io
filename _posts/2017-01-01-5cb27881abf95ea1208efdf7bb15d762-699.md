### Name of taxi: Basic taxi

Before getting in, I made sure the driver knew where to take me. I have an Australian accent, but other drivers have heard the location correctly when repeated if they didn't get it the first time. He struggled to understand. When we'd left the taxi bay, he informed me that I'd need to pay p30 extra because his meter was showing p10 instead of p30. I agreed to the ride, explaining that I've made the trip before and know the rate. As we travelled, I noticed that lines on the meter display were not clear, so the full number was not visible. When he told me it displayed p10, it would have shown p40, but it was not clear. When we arrived, I asked for the cost as it was not visible and he printed a receipt to show p89 and told me to pay p120 as p30 needed to be added. P89 is the normal rate I pay for the trip, so I was unwilling to pay extra. I gave him the amount I paid a taxi earlier today (p90, plus small tip) and told him to get his meter fixed. The receipt shows an 8 minute trip (2.48pm-2.56pm) with 00:02 waiting time and a charge of p89 for 4.2km travel.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
