### Name of taxi: Dont know

Hailed the taxi with my mother. He refused to open the door unless we talk to him thru the passenger window. Told him our destination (recto corner morayta). He said its traffic in the pier area. I told him we dont pass by there and i'll just give him directions. He said he doesnt care and just wants to know how much we will pay him. My mother said we usually pay 140 and she'll just pay 150. Driver made rude faces and went off.

```Refused boarding, Over charging```
