### Name of taxi: Mge

I ask him if its ok to go first la neuva to drop off my lola "senior citizen" then after we go to sto. Nino which is near in la neuva to drop off my cousin so that after we can go straight where i am going which is I mistakenly tell him to emall
Which is "ayala mall" so he insisted me that he plug down the rate again because thats there rules and he attended the new seminar which is he told me that the seminar told them that kind of route should be plug down the rate again so i ask him why? So again he told me that thats the rules. So i told him that we are your customers si how could you do that plugging down the rate when we are straight having straight route so he told us that "aggressively saying" CGE PANGHAWA MO DRI PANGITA MOG LAIN TAXI" ok go down find another taxi he told us rudely. My lola was afraid and told the driver ok i will just go down my lola is a senior citizen and me carrying my 8 month old baby. Then i told him ok we will go down and i will report you to the lto of what ypu did then he suddenly gonout and keep yelling on us pointing finger on us after i told him that i will report him. I was about the name of the taxi but this is the thing i remember because i was so afraid ABM 6312
