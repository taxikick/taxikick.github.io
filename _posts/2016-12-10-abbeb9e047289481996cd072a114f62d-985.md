### Name of taxi: M&J

Early morning. I had my sisters with me and we have not yet all eaten breakfast. I ask the driver if we could go to the nearest fastfood to have drive thru. But when when he saw the line he refuse. And i dont get why? Does he not want to have more meter up while doing nothing but wait? It pissed me off coz my sisters need to eat and they'll be performing in school. To this taxi driver may you never have mornings without breakfast
