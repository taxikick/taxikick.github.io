### Name of taxi: Al Suhaiden

I'm on my way home. From Polymedic Plaza to Nazareth. We grab a taxi. I said the correct address. After a couple of seconds, the taxi driver grab his celphone and he was shouting very loudly and angrily on his phone call. He's even texting while driving.And he took us in a wrong way. He said he misundersood what the address he heard. Kala niya sa Limketkai daw. He misheard what I said because he is busy on his phone call. And then he keeps on peeing for 2 times. He keeps on stopping by and parking. It tooks us a long time to reach our home. And after that I saw the meter price 128 pesos. 500 bill binigay ko. Tapos ibibigay nya sana change ay 228. Sabi ko kulang to. Tapos binigyan ako 100 pesos which is kulang pa rin. It supposed to be 372. Inoff nya kaagad yong meter para hindi ko makita pero nakita ko talaga na 128 pesos yon. Kulang ng 44 na change siya.. Tsk! Mukha talaga siya manloloko. Scammer! Tsk! The taxi driver is fat and wearing a silver bracelet.
