title: ABE424 - NAIA terminal 1

### Name of taxi: M Urbano

My grab driver dropped me off at wrong terminal. I needed to go to domestic terminal 4. Taxi driver approached me and said he could take him. I thought he was legit since there were several taxis of like kind and well marked. Got in showed me a menu that says the cost would be P2,300 to go not even a kilometer. We got into an argument, i wanted to be dropped off immediately. But we negotiated P500 which is still outrageous. I ama travel writer and want to promote the PI, but when sh*t like this happens itâ€™s pretty hard. Only warning, if ever I come back to the Philippines I will NEVER take a cab. Only uber or grab. These cab drivers are giving the PI a bad name.
