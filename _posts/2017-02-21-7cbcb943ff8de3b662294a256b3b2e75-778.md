---

### Name of taxi: Don't know

The meter runs very fast and starts from 0 peso... i asked him since I get on the taxi whether he used the meter, he said yes but his meter run quickly. When we arrived at mall of asia he charged me at 2314.16 peso. I told him that we came here many times but maximum we paid only 250peso. He insisted to take 2314 peso... then i told him to take me to police station. He told me that i have to pay if for the price rise. Am ok but take us to the police. We have only 500 peso left, i told him as I'm leaving this country tonight. He said any currency is ok for him. I insisted i have only 500 peso. Then he is accepted... i went off to take photo of his licence plate and his face. And give him 500 peso. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
