### Name of taxi: Unknown

When I was about to pay i looked at his meter and it wasnt on but when i got in he did press the meter...so i was confused why there was nothing! he then said he was an airport taxi and was charging me P250 which is far from what I usually pay for that destination. I said it was too much... But he insisted its not his fault that I didn't see that he's an airport taxi! Very rude and obviously trying to cheat me.. I said sorry but all I have is P120... This is at 12:30am. I got down and was gonna take a picture of his cab but he knew already and zoomed away. I hope he really gets what he deserves.. I'm sure he always does this to his passengers.
