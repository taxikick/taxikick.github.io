title: UVN930 - Lower Bicutan
---

### Name of taxi: 

He was asking for additional charge because according to him, our destination (Lower Bicutan) is a remote place. He said the road is one way only and he needs to drive around the place just to reach the main highway. It will used more of his taxi's gasoline. We gave him additional 20pesos, and he acted like he was not satisfied. When we go down from the taxi, we heard that he said something bad. Then we found out that the road is not one way because he turned back and drove away. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
