### Name of taxi: Grab Car

I booked a grab car at the airport via their booth. It was accepted by the driver but upon learning that the destination is in Sandigan Quezon City he called me up and said I'll accept if you increase fare to 700. Original cost indicated by grab is 475. He then cancelled my booking. Then he accepted the next person who booked after me. He was reprimanded by the booking office when he arrived at the airport but he was very rude and airhead saying go ahead report me.
