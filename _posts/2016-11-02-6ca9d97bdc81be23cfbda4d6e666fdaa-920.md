title: TYV457 - NAIA Terminal 3 Arrival
---

### Name of taxi: LBR

Route is from NAIA T3 to Cartimar, Pasay.  He asked for P250 but I disagreed and asked him to turn on the meter.  He did reluctantly.  Actual cost was only P141.

Taxi looks clean on the outside but is actually in very poor condition on the inside.  I gave him P150 and he doesn't have change.  I asked for the receipt and he could not give it.  There was no paper.

```Contracting, No receipt```
