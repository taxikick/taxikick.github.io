### Name of taxi: I dont know

I am an elderly woman, 62 years old and i was driving myself. Even if i had signaled in advance and the taxi driving way behind me was quite far from my car, he sped up probably so he could be first. I believe he does NOT understand turn signal lights. He was so upset i was in front of him that be began honking, screaming curse words, and waving the bad finger at me. This monster should be removed from the road. His attitude, poor understanding of road etiquette/rules and overall driving are dangerous. I informed a nearby officer but he didnt do anything. Remiving hum from driving can save lives.
