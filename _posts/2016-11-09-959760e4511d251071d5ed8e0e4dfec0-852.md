title: UWN325 - Rode the taxi from NAIA to Brgy Holy Spirit, QC
---

### Name of taxi: PM HELY

Boarded the taxi in NAIA and got off in Brgy Holy Spirit in QC. There were 3 of us and I was the last to get off the taxi and was responsible to pay for the taxi fee. I was  charged P3,800. I am a senior citizen and there was nobody else in the area at that time. I was scared to argue with the driver since he was already very rude from the time we rode the taxi in NAIA. I felt that I have no other choice but to pay.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
