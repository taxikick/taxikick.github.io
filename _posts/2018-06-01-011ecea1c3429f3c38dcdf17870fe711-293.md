### Name of taxi: Unknown

When he picked us up from our hotel in lapu lapu he demanded p100 over the meter and I reluctantly agreed because I didn't want to wait for another taxi. Then I made a quick stop to get milk for my baby and the driver tried to get an additional p50 or he would kick us out of the taxi. He was abusive and corrupt and he threatened my wife and 1 year old child.
