### Name of taxi: Unknown

We are trying to get a taxi for almost an hour now.  As usual, like those taxi who is choosy of passenger. They pull down the window to ask where will be the location. Unfortunately he don't want  us "maybe" because I am headed to greenhills. While the next passenger is going to Kalentong but offers addition fee.

```Refused boarding```
