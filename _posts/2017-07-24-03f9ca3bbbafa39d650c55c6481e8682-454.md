### Name of taxi: *failed to get info

07/24/17 @6:20ish PM we rode this taxi going to UP Techno Hub along with my friend, We had the Taxi enter the 2nd gate as my friend will alide to HSBC..and so I dropped my friend to HSBC and directed the driver to go to Convergys, that's the time that he said that I should give him "dag-dag", in verbatim "Dapat may dag-dag, kasi pina ikot-ikot nyo ko, di naman 'to FX", I responded "Why?, naka metro naman ho tayo"., then he didn't stopped murmuring, he even said that nextime we should use Uber instead, and he even threatened me saying "tatandaan kita, tiga dun din lang ako sa Krus na Ligas", which alarmed me as it may be a threat to our safety, I'll also have this reported in our Barangay and see if we can have this Driver blottered. pleae take immediate action as this driver may cause not just inconvenience but may also serve as a threat to commuters who's only concern is their convenience that's why they use this kind of transportation, we're hoping to hear from your department. thanks!
