### Name of taxi: MGE

When i gave him my money he insisted that my change is 20 but the meter says 64 pesos only. And I gave him 100 pesos... and he refused to give me change ... he told me this exact phrase "sir puwede na yan wala po kasi akong pasahero pabalik eh". 

```Over charging, Not giving exact change```
