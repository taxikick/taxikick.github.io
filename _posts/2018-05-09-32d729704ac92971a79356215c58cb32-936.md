title: TXY451 - Guadalupe going to BGC
---

### Name of taxi: ANTZ

The taxi driver refused to board me when I was alone. A barker appeared with another passenger, two of us going to BGC, the taxi driver boarded us. After few minutes inside the taxi, he said we need to pay 100 pesos each. I refused  and asked the taxi driver to use his meter but he just ignored me. I'm running late at the office and the other passenger inside did not do anything as well to contest the wrong doing of the driver, that's why I was also forced to follow taxi driver's demand.
