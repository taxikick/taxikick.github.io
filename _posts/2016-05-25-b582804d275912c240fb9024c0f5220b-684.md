### Name of taxi: LBR

Driver charging on a per head basis. From MOA Complex to EDSA LRT, 25/head, since there were 4 of us he was expecting 100, when it only usually costs us 80-90. To add to that he was even taunting us saying: "lugi kayo? sabihin nyo kung lugi pa kayo?" we weren't answering at first but he kept on repeating himself: "sabihin nyo, lugi kayo?" and so one of us answered: "oo kuya lugi kame, ok na?" it did not stop there because he said: "lugi layo, edi baba nalang kayo!" we said: "sige kuya baba nalang kame, pakitabi nalang" however he sped off (still inside MOA complex). we insisted to for him to pull over and we went down.

```Over charging, Contracting```
