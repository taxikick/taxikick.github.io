### Name of taxi: 4got the name

We were 2 passengers in the taxi and our destinations wer different and so im the 2nd passenger dont know the agreement between the driver n the 1st passenger. Then i was shocked wen the driver ask 200 pesos to the 1st passenger when its bit near from the port & also he also asked me 200 pesos too. The 1st passenger thought that 200 pesos will be divided but cost us 200 each. Usually my fare from port to my boarding house is around 120-140. So 200 pesos is bit too much. He was taking advantage to us coz it is jeepney strike
