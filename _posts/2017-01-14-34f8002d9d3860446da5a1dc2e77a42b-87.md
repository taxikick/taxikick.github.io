### Name of taxi: Edmichelyn Trans

I will try to narrate how it started- When we entered Greenheights Subd., the driver asked "sa dulo ba?" And then I answered "hindi po, tuturo ko na lang" He thought I was being rude with the way I said and then he started blabbing things about how I shouldnt be that way. Noticing that the driver is not anymore making sense and he is also starting to argue with my mother, I started to answer back. We were arguing back and forth up to a point that the driver threatened us. That's when I told him to stop but he doesnt stop until we arrived to our destination. We were really scared the whole ride. That man could have been hiding something in his car.

```Rude behavior, Verbal harassment```
