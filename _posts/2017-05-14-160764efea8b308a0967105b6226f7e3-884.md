### Name of taxi: Unknown

While I was walking down the street near SM Baguio, me and my brother was shocked because of this taxi (SUV type-didn't notice the name) was very fast until the vehicle's bumper hit my left leg and knee and a young boy from his back and he started shouting and talking unnecessary words.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
