title: NWI380 - BANILAD ROAD, CEBU CITY

### Name of taxi: N/A

Around 9:30 pm,  I rode this taxi with the plate number NMI 380 in Panagdait, Mabolo with my girlfriend. The taxi driver asked me where to go so I told him Tintay and we have to take the A.S.  Fortuna -  Banilad route because I still have to drop my gf in banilad area. When we reached A.S. Fortuna, the taxi suddenly stopped and the driver said that he needs to buy a bread since he is hungry. I told him if he could pause the meter since that's what the other taxis would do (I have experienced where taxi drivers voluntarily pauses their meter when they have to pee or gas their taxi). He refuses and said he no longer wants to buy a bread. He continued to drive, albeit very fast overtaking other cars. When we reached the banilad road, I told him to stopped so I could drop off my gf. He said that he needs another flag down (40 php, which is supposed to be 30 php). I ask him why and he said this is his revenge for me asking him to pause the meter earlier.
