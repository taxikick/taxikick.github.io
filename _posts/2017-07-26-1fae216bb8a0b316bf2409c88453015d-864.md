title: TYZ-780 - Congressional Village to Congressional Avenue\
---

### Name of taxi: Lannie

Me and my girlfriend hailed him at TriNoma to go to Congressional Village and asked him if it's okay to add another stop nearby along Congressional Avenue. He said okay. We arrived at Congressional Village, asked the driver to wait a bit because I had to help my girlfriend with her bags and walk her home. I went back to the taxi and on the way out, someone else was flagging him down. He entertained the supposed passenger going to fairview. He asked me if it's okay that they also ride because I'm on my way out already. I said no. He shook his head and told the others that he'll come back for them. Near my stop, he asked me to add more to the fare due to me not agreeing to ride the other passenger and for also having 2 stops. Just wanting to get out, I paid him P140. Meter said P103.
