### Name of taxi: JOSMEN

The driver refused to board us and referred us to other tax that will lead us to wait if there'll be another taxi to come in but we saw him that other passenger talk to him and let that woman rode. I was so mad with the driver coz I really need to go home my stomach ache due to my surgery. I just have my check up with my doctor. That kind of driver should be reported to LTFRB.
