title: UVV833 - From Manilia airport to Makati (Manila)
---

### Name of taxi:  

I took a meter taxi at the airport to go to Makati. The taxi had a meter type that I had never seen before. It was counting km. I know the distance from the aiport to my house is about 8km but the meter showed 30km at the end. The driver told me the price to pay was 1,200PHP (40PHP per km). At the end, I protested and asked for a receipt. The driver refused to provide one and I threaten him to call the police. I left the taxi without paying at the end... I wanted to report that as I'm afraid it could happen to someone else. The driver said that his colleagues had poorly set up the km calculation system on the wheels but I have doubts about that...

```Over charging, No receipt```
