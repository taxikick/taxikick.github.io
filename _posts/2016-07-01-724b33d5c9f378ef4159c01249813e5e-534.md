### Name of taxi: 

The heavy rains pour during that time. When I flag the taxi, I opened the door at the backseat (im dripping wet) and told him if he could move forward a bit because we have a companion that is a senior citizen and standing somewhere where there is roof. The taxi driver rudely replied to me, " just close the door cause the taxi inside is getting wet." And he drove rushly without letting us ride in.
