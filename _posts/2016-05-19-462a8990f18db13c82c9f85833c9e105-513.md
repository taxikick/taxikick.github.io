### Name of taxi: 

The rain was falling heavily when we decided to ride a taxi, I know the system, of course, because I'm always using it for transport. Alam ko na medyo traffic in Regalado area, so me and my friend agreed that the driver will just add 50 pesos to the normal tariff of 40 pesos (I thought na makakatipid kami). When we reach our destination (SM Fairview), which is very near FCM, I was surprised to see that the meter was currently counting to almost 100 pesos. I'm suspicious but I did not react. nung bababa na kami, i gave him the 100 peso bill and told him to keep the change, but he still demand us to give him 50 pesos, I got angry, syempre di naman ako ignorant, pero the look he gave us makes us scared, palaban ako at kaya ko syang sagut-sagutin and alam yun ng friend ko kaya para di na magkagulo binigyan na ng friend ko ng 50 pesos yung driver, then pumasok na kami sa mall.
I know it's not a big amount of money, but I will not let anyone make me look like a fool so I decided to report him, i don't know his name but I wish that the plate number I gave is enough para magbayad sya (not literally).
