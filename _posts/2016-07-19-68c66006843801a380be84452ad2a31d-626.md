title: UVZ380 - Picked me up at Trinoma dropped me off in cubao
---

### Name of taxi: Don't remember

I got his cab at Trinoma with a friend, we told the driver cubao. When we got to cubao my friend got off at gateway and I then told the driver p.tuazon. my drop off was no more than 5mins from gateway. He told me extra, I said why? And he got mad told me we told him cubao. I said p.tuazon is in cubao. He was insisting and getting very upset I said no and wasn't changing my mind. Then he asks me if I'm filipina- I say yes what does that have to do with anything? He says in a snarly defensive manner why do you speak English? i saw why does it matter? Does that make me less Filipino? Its my first language!! Then he says all Filipinos know two drop off two rates. I told him no that's a common practice not the law! He then asked why I'm talking to him like that, I said he started it all I am giving him is answer. He said why? Because he's "only a driver'. He tried EVERY tactic on me for extra money - wawa victim, authority of law, devaluing me as a Filipino?! Incredibly RUDE and manipulative!
