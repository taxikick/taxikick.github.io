### Name of taxi: Ni√±al taxi

Me, my mom, my 7 yr. old daughter and 8 mos. old son were already inside the taxi. We rode at AA guadalupe. I told the driver our destination (deca homes bacayan), he didn't complain at first but when we reached near cebu doctors hospital, he suddenly told us to get another taxi because his tummy was aching. It was such a rude act since it was already 8pm and we have kids with us, my 8 month old son was already sleeping. We refused at first to get out but he insisted that he cannot anymore reach bacayan. The driver was already old around 60+ but wa cyay batasan, wa naikog nga naa mi bata dala.

```Rude behavior```
