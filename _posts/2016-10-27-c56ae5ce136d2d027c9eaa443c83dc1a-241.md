### Name of taxi: BRAM

Before the ride, I asked the driver if they can provide a receipt since I need that for reimbursement. My fare was Php180.00. After the taxi ride, the driver was giving me a print of the total report of the whole transactions made by the taxi which amounted to 31K. It was not the receipt of my ride. The driver did not return my payment.

```No receipt```
