### Name of taxi: Unknown

We took a cab at SM City Bacolod around 6pm, we take a taxi from the same spot at least 3times a week. We get in the car and tell the driver that we are going to our home address but will have to stop somewhere on the way to drop off a letter and it wont take us more than a few seconds, he responds that he will have to flag us down again at the stop, i said u dont have to ill take care of it when we get there, my intention was to give him a tip even when undeserved, he looks straight forward and said that we will have to ride the next cab cuz of traffic, its Bacolod city there is no traffic. This driver should not be on the roads if he doesnt want to work.
