### Name of taxi: 

I flagged down this taxi at around 6:20 a.m. Sure it was raining, but it was still a manageable downpour. I told the driver where I was heading. After several meters down the road, he suddenly told me, "Ita-transfer ko na lang kayo, baka hindi ako umabot." I didn't understand the "umabot" part bec. his plate no. was not banned from EDSA, being Monday. He then pointed at a taxi across him and said, "Ayun po." Meaning I get out of his darn taxi, brave the rains and find out if the other taxi is free to take me to my destination. Pissed, I retorted, "Bakit mo pa ako pinasakay kanina?" He had no legit answer. But clearly rude behavior. His LFTRB ID says the operator no. is 0998-552-2148. The no. painted below the window says 0939-364-0971

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
