### Name of taxi: Ballat and Fe

It was 6:00PM when I arrived at my destination in Morato, I realized I only have 80pesos and my next bill is 1000. I asked him politely if he had change for 1000 because I only realized it until then, and I was hoping he had change since it's already evening. He got angry at pinagalitan niya ko. He told me I should've told him earlier and that because of people like me, natatagalan daw siya. I know I should've checked my money on the way, so I apologized but he just kept rambling on about the inconvenience I brought him. Di ko naman po alam na mapapagalitan ako just because chineck ko ang pera ko nung dumating na.

Sinabihan ko siya na magpapabarya ako sa tapat na McDo, he complained again and said non-verbatim, "Iikot na naman tayo, umiiwas na nga tayo sa traffic eh." He then cursed and said "Tangina naman," finally turning the taxi towards McDo.

When I went back after around 5mins, I think he became a little lightheaded. I asked him how much (I cannot see the meter from where I was), he said P160. I think he also overcharged because prior to coming to McDo, my bill was P120. I don't think P40 ang madadagdag sa pagpunta lang sa tapat ng building at paghintay ng 5mins. I paid anyway, but the verbal harrassment and rude behavior was what got me complaining here.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
