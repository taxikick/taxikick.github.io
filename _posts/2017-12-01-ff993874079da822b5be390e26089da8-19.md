title: UWL660 - Tandang Sora, Quezon City

### Name of taxi: Sturdy

We flagged the driver down at Tandang Sora Quezon City and told him we were going to the airport. He was insisting that it was traffic and wanted to set a fixed fare of 800 pesos. He would not lower the price. We said that if it was truly terribly traffic, then okay we would pay him 800 since we were scared of missing our flight. After a few minutes, we noticed that his meter was off. We asked him politely to turn it on and he said that it was broken. We said we needed to see how much the actual price was in case there was no traffic and in case we went down before reaching the airport but he would not agree. He kept on saying that we already agreed to the 800 and that there is no need to turn on the meter. We told him we had no problem adding to the total meter fare if the traffic was really horrible and we told him we agreed to pay him 800 pesos only if it seemed reasonable depending on the traffic. He argued the entire time that the fixed price was 800 and refused to turn on the meter. We caught the exchange on video in case more proof is needed. He ended up dropping us and our luggage off a short distance from where he picked us up and charged us 70 pesos.

```Over charging, No meter```
