title: AXA7519 - Lapulapu 
---

### Name of taxi: Gilgal

I got in the taxi from Basak Mandaue and of course first off getting in,  I had to give him my destination but he responded with a rude question and tune. 
It was a long way to Deca 1 Lapulapu and as usual traffic is bad. 
When I'm about to get off,  the meter was 267. I gave him 300 but he refused to give me a change because he said it was traffic. 
I told him I had to pay what's in the meter and not more than that.  He was  pissed. VERY RUDE BEHAVIOR! 
I don't mind giving a bit extra if only he was acting like a normal being. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
