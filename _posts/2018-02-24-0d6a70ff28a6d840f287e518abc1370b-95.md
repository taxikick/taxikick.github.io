### Name of taxi: Unknown

We took this taxi from Greenhills shopping mall around 9:10pm Feb 24,2018 At first when we get inside the taxi, my daughter was feeling dizzy because of the taxi smell that is very unpleasant and he warning me maybe my daughter will vomit, i answer him in a very polite way. I said ‘dont worry she will only feel dizzy but she wont vomit and hes reply was ‘better you dont take any cab’ but i refuse to reply with his rude respond with me.
While driving He hit a one guy passing by a street along Kamuning area because of overspeeding. And he was talking a bad words knowing that there is a 10 yr old passenger behind him. I still keep silent and stay calm.
While reaching my place along chico street near from anonas, he ask me why did i said a wrong location to him. Wrong location? I mention anonas as my main landmark so it wont be hard for him to find the place. And my location is just a 1 min ride from anonas. Could you pls take a legal action with this problem? Our country is one of the most worstest ever place to live, reason why because of this people who dun know how to respect woman.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
