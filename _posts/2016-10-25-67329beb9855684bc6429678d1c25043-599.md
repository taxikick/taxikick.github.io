### Name of taxi: I forgot the name. white Vios taxi

Around 9 AM, under the sweltering heat of the sun, I was trying to hail a cab for my parents who were going to st.lukes BGC. After waiting, this cab pulled over, I opened the door, he immediately asked where they were going, told him the place. Right after that, he gave us a smirk then drove off. My phone was not with me that time so I did not have the chance to request for a Grab or Uber instead and I did not want my mom and dad to ride the Bus going there as it was already rush hour.  This taxi driver should not be driving a taxi at all. 

```Refused boarding```
