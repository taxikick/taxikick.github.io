### Name of taxi: FEDERAL

The driver asked me fot my drop point, and I told him somewhere in commonwealth qc, he the replied amounting 1000 pesos, because of the proximity and the taxi lane queuing at T3, my basic fare from commonwealth to t3 is 350 only.. Way too far from 1000 pesos..

```Over charging, No flag down of meter```
