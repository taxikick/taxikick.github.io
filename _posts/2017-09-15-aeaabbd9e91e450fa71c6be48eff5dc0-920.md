### Name of taxi: Mic REM

At Balagtas Plaza around 5:40AM I rode this taxi, he is heading in the direction of Nagtahan bridge I was on the side going to Makati he even U-turn his taxi to get me. I told him I am going to Kalayaan Ave Makati. When we are in Inviernes cor Pedro Gil he told me that he will transfer me to other taxi as his unit is coding and my drop location is very traffic and he will head back to Valenzuela and ask me transfer my taxi ride. He drove me going to Concordia College very out of my way to fetch me new taxi. On the near gasoline station he ask me to go down.  I hope he did not turn his car for me as there was also other free taxi cab during that time.
