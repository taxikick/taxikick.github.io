title: UVL300 - Manila international airport terminal 1

### Name of taxi: Unknown

We came to the wrong terminal which is terminal 1 instead of terminal 3. It is about 3km apart from both terminals. The taxi driver told us he is charging 40 only to drive us to terminal 3. Upon arriving, he told us the rate is in USD instead of PHP! So a 3km driving is 2,000PHP! We didn't want to argue too much as we were rushing for flight boarding. It really pissed us off!

```Over charging```
