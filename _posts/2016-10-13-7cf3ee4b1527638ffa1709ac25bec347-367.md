title: HBE809 - Yakal Street Makati
---

### Name of taxi: KEIFER

The driver 
first agreed with our final destination and pretended to know how to get there. After a while he said he wants to rest and the destination is too far for him. We believe he wanted to avoid traffic but there is always traffic in Manila and he knew it. He then dropped us off somewhere in Makati and we had no clue where we were. We had a hard time to find our way back. Before he accepts a passenger he must agree or disagree but not roaming US around, charging money from us and then dropping us in nowhere just because he wants to "rest". 

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
