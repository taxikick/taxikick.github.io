title: ACD1912 - Hailed in Cubao destined to Don Antonio, Commonwealth Ave.
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Hailed the taxi from Dagupan Bus Terminal in Cubao to Don Antonio. When we arrived at our destination, the meter was at 150+ and I paid 200. I then proceeded to get my luggage from the trunk. He went out of his taxi and even asked for an additional 20 php on top of the 200. I refused and went inside our house, he stayed out yelling words outside our gate. Extremely wrong in so many levels! 

He was also watching a movie from his phone while driving. It was placed in the compartment behind the steering wheel where the speedometer and gas meter is placed. He also murmurs and puts on a pissed off face during traffic that makes passengers have an uneasy experience.
