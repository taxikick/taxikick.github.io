title: UWC870 - From Shaw Blvd to San Juan City

### Name of taxi: I forgot to check. It was a white Cab.

Sa lahat ng nasakyan ko si kuya na yata ang pinaka kupal sa lahat ng taxi driver. Yung iba pasimple pa, itong si manong driver garapalan ang kahayupan. He tried a lot of roads he said he knew but he failed to get to the right way. So my usual 60+ ride to san juan went up to 110+. Parepareho naman tayo nagtatrabaho. He asked me several times if we can take the route and i said i dont know that way so maybe we can stick to my usual way, he answered "Nadaanan ko na dati ito" and still proceeded (oh kupal diba?) Not only once but he did it 4 times. He sound stupid and he looked stupid. Wala ring ayos sa pagmamaneho. Alam na alam na iniikot ikot nya lang para tumaas yung bill. Kaya nawawalan kami ng tiwala sa mga taxi driver.
