### Name of taxi: Jimison Taxi

I told him my destination and told him the best route. He did not answer back. When he did not follow my preferred route, I asked him what route he will take because the roads are not familiar to me..He did not answer me. I asked him again with a louder voice, he still did not answer me. I already got nervouse cause I was alone in the cab. I shouted and demanded to be pulled over. After a couple of minutes, he pulled over and I hurriedly went out of the cab.

Drivers like him are the reason why we, women, are afraid to take cabs in Metro Manila.

```His route going to my destination was unfamiliar to me and he refused to say what route he will take to go to my destination. This made me nervous as I was alone in the cab.```
