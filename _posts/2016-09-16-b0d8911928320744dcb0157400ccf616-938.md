### Name of taxi: NA

My wife is on her daily route to wait for a taxi. There is a driver on standby and he called my wife. When my wife is already seated inside the taxi, the driver asked where is the destination. My wife said it's in ortigas. The driver suddenly said he "I need to pick somebody else". Very unprofessional.
