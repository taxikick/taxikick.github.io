### Name of taxi: Ruel sabenith pride of coron

Would like to complain the taxi driver with plate# UWL607, who acts rude and charging us additional fare of P50 upon arriving at Blumentritt station.

6pm from Robinson Ermita, we, together with my husband and 2year old son rode on his taxi going to our home blumentritt. We arrived at blumentritt station, the driver don't want to send us to our exact address, 2 streets from blumentritt station, thus he said "traffic dyan, kung gusto nyo magdagdag kayo ng P50."
I told him, to have consideration bec we have 2 year old baby and it was raining, kaya kami nag taxi para ihatid sa bahay namin, sana nag Lrt na lang kami kung dito sa station din kami bababa. Unfortunately, the driver insist to have additional fare of P50 aside from the meter. Since we didn't agree for the additinal fare of P50, he stopped in front of blumentritt station. The driver never considered despite of rain and carrying a baby as well. 


```Over charging, Rude behavior```
