### Name of taxi: Reymiles

I boarded in a taxi bay (reymiles) in sm north edsa the block. I told the driver named Jesus Lopez to drive me to kingspoint subdivision-just across mindanao ave and quirino ave intersection. He told me to add ₱30 for the fare. I agreed because I dont want to argue anymore, and i have headache. The fare is ₱96 since the traffic in mindanao ave was very light than the usual ₱120. He didnt give me 20% discount for student, and didnt even gave the change for ₱140 that I gave.  Hoping for a considerate action by the management.
