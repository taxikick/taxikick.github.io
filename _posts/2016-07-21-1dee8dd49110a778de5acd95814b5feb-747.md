### Name of taxi: 

This taxi driver verbally shouted at us. He was being sarcastic when i was just telling him the way. I feel unsafe about this driver. I hope this gets out and he will never be a taci driver anymore. Rude drivers shall never be accepted in this community! 

```Refused boarding, Reckless driving```
