### Name of taxi: Unable to determine

Usually these taxi cabs are lining-up near FairView Village Lawaan Talisay City Cebu. Upon boarding on the taxi, we informed the driver that we need to take the Hi-Way route since it's weekend and around 8PM time so there should be no heavy traffic. However he insisted to get on a different route (SRP) which would take long in terms of distance. Usually If we took the Hi-Way route it would only cost us around P200-P220 considering the heavy traffic. We are a regular taxi riders and most of the time if we took the SRP route the bill would be around P240-P255 with the heavy traffic. But this time, with no traffic we are charge P285 pesos. We asked for a receipt and he did not provide us either and the bill exchange he given to us is lacking. This taxi driver is arrogant and would not listen to his customer. I believe his taxi meter is tampered also. The condition of the vehicle is poor and the AC is not cool at all. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
