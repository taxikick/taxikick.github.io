### Name of taxi: M.G.E.

Upon boarding the taxi at Greenbelt 3 I had noticed the meter wasn't on. I had kindly requested to turn on the meter, he turned it on and mumbled something in tagalog which was in the line of giving him more money because there's traffic. I had refused it, saying it's ridiculous to ask that since he's a taxi driver and this is his job. Upon exiting the taxi my partner was kind enough to give him a 20 peso tip. He then continued asking for more money and I obviously told him he wouldn't get any since the fare was only 96 and he received 120 pesos. He then started to yell and make threats  while almost running over my feet. We immediately left, fearing for our own safety. The problem here is, that he was threatening us and now knows where we live.

```Over charging, No meter```
