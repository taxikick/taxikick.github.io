title: TXR862 - Technohub qc

### Name of taxi: Vinelean

My girlfriend rode the cab around 9:30 pm. She was the 1st to call the cab but the cab accepted 2 other passengers aside from her with the same way. When they got to technohub, the driver is asking them to pay the full meter of 180php for each person which is not acceptable because the passengers agreed to have a fair share of the meter

```Malicious mischief, No flag down of meter```
