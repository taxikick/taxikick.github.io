title: GXS-133 - From Hernan Cortes up to Cybergate Fuente
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

He was such a reckless and imprudent driver in that during our trip I was so scared that we would caught up by accident (glad it didn't happen). He usually dash even though the traffic is so bad and immediately stop just near the next vehicle. There were like a dozen times that we almost collided with another vehicle because of this. He is not the type of person who will give way to another vehicle and will take the chance even when the traffic light is already yellow going to red or another vehicle is moving. He even used the counter-lane and sped off. He even talked to his wife/girlfriend why on course for a minute or two. And lastly he was always changing lanes even when things are too risky. All these happened during our trip from Hernan Cortes to Fuente. Damn, i was scared to death that time though I did not try to talk to him since he looks so irritated like he was using some kind of substance IDK.
