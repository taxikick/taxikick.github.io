### Name of taxi: Revisan

i ride the taxi at ayala fairview terraces going to cielito subdivision via maligaya drive at around 7pm when we arrived near the entrance of the subdivision the driver kept saying "nako labasan mga studyante sana di kita sinakay!" "wala na akong gas ano ba yan traffic!" so i said "kuya bakit ka pumila sa mall alam mo pala wala kanang gas eh kaya ako nag taxi kasi umuulan may sakit ako" then the driver said " wala ka magagawa! kung hindi ako papagas eh kakalabas ko lang alam ko ba traffic pala bumaba ka! hindi ko kilangan bayad mo!" so i was forced to get off and walk along the road raining i was so disapointed how taxi drivers treat their customers i am a girl and it was already 7 pm and the place is not that safe my house is 200 meters away from the entrance
