### Name of taxi: Unknown

The meter's counter was too fast. Yung timer hindi per 1 second ang patak, it is 3x faster. Tapos nung tinanong ko kung bakit mabilis patak ng metro bigla syang naging defensive, giving non-sequitur reasoning/iniiba usapan. This is not the first time I encountered this kind of taxi meter manipulation, just didn't have time to report the older two thinking it's a glitch but this is starting to become a modus.

```Tampered or broken meter```
