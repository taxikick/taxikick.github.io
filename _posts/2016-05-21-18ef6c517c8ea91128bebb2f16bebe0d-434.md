### Name of taxi: 3479

My friends and I were on vacation in Davao (four of us). We asked him to take us to Jack's Ridge from Roxas St. He said he knew the place. Obviously it's a tourist spot. It took us more than an hour to reached the place hindi naman traffic. During our travel one of my friends asked kung malapit na ba kasi 45mins na kami sa loob ng taxi. He said malayo pa. I was using googlemap so alam ko na iniikot ikot nya kami. Then naiinis na ako I blurted out "kuya iniikot ikot nyo na kami im using gps" dapat umakyat ka na dun kasi lumampas na tayo and he said "lumampas na ba?" At nag U-turn uli siya pero dapat hindi na kasi mas malayo na yung way dapat dumiretso na siya. Then suddenly he asked us "diretso ba" We knew na alam nya daan at nagmamaangmaangan lang siya at before that tinanong namin kung alam nya place.It was traumatic. Sumakay kami ng 11:20 para maglunch sa dun and we reached 12:50 and ended up paying  P348 so naging P350. We were so disappointed kasi we are expecting  lot from Davao taxi drivers. Oo metered nga pero iniikot ikot kami. Wala ring receipt at napakarude. Then pag uwi namin nagtaxi lang din kami 20mins lng nandun na kami and we paid just P120. Name nung driver eh EDUARDO D. FERNANDEZ. Im from Lucena and my friends are from Manila. Madalas kaming magtravel pero ngayon lang nangyari na sobrang ganid ng driver at makapal ang mukha. Nung bumaba kami patay malisya lang ang driver. It was not a good day nalate kami sa Lunch.Bad for tourism and it's Davao.

```Over charging, No receipt```
