### Name of taxi: Elren taxi

Entered taxi 5.56pm, driver spent a lot of time playing with meter once I entered, meter appeared normal at halfway mark it had begun at 40p at this point it was 75p, upon approaching sm seaside meter had hit 178p I then watched it quickly rise to 187p, when confronting driver about it he became aggressive towards me, he refused to show me his id so I just zoomed in on it with my camera, he continued to be aggressive so I just payed the fair, he then gave me a receipt which was almost unreadable

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
