### Name of taxi: RYO AKI

This driver is definitely VERY drunk. Or VERY high on illegal drugs. He was stopping for no reason on very small bumps etc., he is also swerving left and right and is having a hard time just to drive straight. He also moves a lot and murmurs weird things. He tried to take a wrong route in which I already decided to go down. NEVER ride this taxi car, very dangerous. (Definitely high in illegal drugs)

```Reckless driving```
