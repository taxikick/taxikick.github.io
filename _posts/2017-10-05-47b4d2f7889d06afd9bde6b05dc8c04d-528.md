### Name of taxi: Sua & Bin

Driver accepted to drop me off to Rockwell Makati, from Mindanao Avenue. Suddenly it rained hard. I asked him if it was okay to take the route to San Juan-Mandaluyong-Makati instead of EDSA, he answered “Puno din doon sa loob”, told him that there is a 30-minute difference if we take that route vs. EDSA. His answer was “MRT? Ayaw mo magMRT? Nagmamadali ka eh”. I didn’t answer. After awhile, he said “Baha na doon sa Mandaluyong”, I told him I’ll check. When we were around SM North area, I informed him of the way I saw, “Kuya, pag P. Guevarra po, F. Martinez tapos pa-Rockwell na po yun?” He answered “Lumipat ka nalang. Itatabi ko doon tapos lumipat ka nalang.” He dropped me off in the middle of EDSA North Ave even though it was raining hard.
