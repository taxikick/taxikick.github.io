### Name of taxi: Lady Angeline

We were from Fatima Valenzuela going to Tondo Medical Center. We already wazed it and all routes were directed towards Monumento (slowest route was 40 mins). We usually have a fare of around 120. Max. 160. The taxi insisted that we take a very long way (Malinta) and even argued that he knows the route better. Our fare was 300 and we were late for an hour.
