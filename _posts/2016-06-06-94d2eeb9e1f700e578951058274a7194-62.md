### Name of taxi: I didnt get it

our bill was like P85. we just asked him if he has P20, for a change from P100. we were planning to give P100 and P5. Then he started to get mad, he said "e wala pa naman kayong binabayad. masyado kayong sigurista. wala kayong binibigay na pera". Yes, we havent paid him yet, we were just asking. Then he was already nonstop scolding at us. I told him that we were just asking, coz we plan to pay him P100. Then he said "Wag niyo ko idamay sa problema niyo", like out of nowhere. I told him why was he so rude at us and he kept on saying, "masyado kayong sigurista, wala pa kayong bayad". we were already having an argument, coz of his rude behavior. As far as I could remember, yea we did pay him P100 before we left his cab. I forgot if he gave us P20 or P15. That doesnt really the case, I'm writing this report, because he should not be assuming and rude to his clients. 

```Rude behavior```
