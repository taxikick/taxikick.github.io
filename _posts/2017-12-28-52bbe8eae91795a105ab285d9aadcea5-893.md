### Name of taxi: Ryan Romar Taxi

taxi stopped, and offered his services. we hopped-in and provided the destination which is from bgc to ospital ng makati(2.4 km in 13 mins as per google maps/maps that time 7:34 pm, not much traffic that time). he keeps asking which hospital, if  is it makati medical. we said it is osmak at pembo down staffhouse. then he realized that it's not makati med and he already assumed heavy traffic on the way, he immediately refused and created an alibi saying he needed to gas-up and his tank is about to be empty. he said no gas station on the way. he declined to go. we noticed his tank was half full and mentioned to him but stil refused to service. to avoid further conflict , we stepped out the taxi immediately.
