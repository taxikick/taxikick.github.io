title: TXY454 - From airport to UP Diliman
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

Rode this taxi from the airport to UP Diliman yesterday early morning (around 3AM). Noticed that the time measured when stopped ran faster than normal. The meter skips a second or two i.e. the meter says 5 secs has gone when in fact only 2 seconds have elapsed.

He also asked an extra P70 on top of the fare meter for dropping off someone at Espana en route to UPD.

```Tampered or broken meter, Texting while driving```
