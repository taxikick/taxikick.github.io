### Name of taxi: Maligaya Taxi

When he dropped us, I was suppose to give him the exact amount but then he said that he doesnt have change, so I asked my colleague to get me an exact amount. He then, asked for more than the metered fare since thats the usual fare as he said. and when we insisted, He said "ang tibay niyo maam, tatandaan ko kayo"
