### Name of taxi: Trends trans

Driver let off a passenger and was hailed by concierge at the condo bldg. We had a lot of luggage and were only going to Terminal 4 which is easy acces and a 15 minute trip. Once we got in the car the driver said it would cost 400 pesos. We said meter plus a tip. He refused to move and then proceeded to unload our baggage. At least he could have demanded his price before we loaded all our bags. This is a very bad guy who should not be allowed to get away with this behaviour.

```Refused boarding, Over charging```
