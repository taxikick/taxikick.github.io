### Name of taxi: Unknown

I have asked the driver before riding in if he has receipt and he answered yes. But when we arrived in my destination, I asked for the receiptbefore giving him my pay and he suddenly said he doesnt have one. So I told him that he said earlier that he has receipt. I wont be riding his taxi if he has no receipt in the first place as I need it to file for fare reimbursement. Then the driver started to shout at me. He even ride off his car when I said I wil only give him 300php instead of 390php.

```No receipt, Rude behavior```
