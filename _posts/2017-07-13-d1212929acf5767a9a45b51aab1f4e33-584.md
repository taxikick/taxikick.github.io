title: UVA230 - From Ever Gotesco to Luzon Avenue Tricycle terminal around 7:45 pm

### Name of taxi: Can't remember 

We told the driver our drop off which is in Luzon. The tricycle driver agreed. When we were already inside the taxi, the taxi driver suddenly said that he will charge 100 pesos. We were shocked because he didn't told us about that before we ride. He also did not activated the meter. The area was near and it was not traffic so there is no reason for him to charge that amount. I'm pretty sure that if he only turned on the meter the charge would only be 50 pesos or so. He was also rude. 

```Over charging, No meter```
