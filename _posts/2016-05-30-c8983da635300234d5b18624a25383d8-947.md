title: UVD336 - camp crame going sm north edsa

### Name of taxi: Joyluck club

Me, my mom, my nephew and my 2 nieces hailed a taxi in-front of our gate near Camp Crame going to SM North EDSA around 2:30 pm. I sat on the front of the taxi, when we reached Cubao I noticed that he was checking on me but I just ignored it, minutes later he put his right hand on my seat, I was shocked, I just stared at his hand (thinking what to do and what he might do next) until he removed his hand on my seat. As he removed his hand he asked me if we were near on our destination like he didn't know where it was and I answered him with serious voice. When we reached the entrance of SM North EDSA, I told him to just stop and drop us there, I paid him and told my mom to quickly get out of that taxi.
