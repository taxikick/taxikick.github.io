### Name of taxi: I don't know

It was almost 10 pm and there was no hint of any traffic. We were going home. He drove so quick, that most of the time you feel like you're riding in a moving race car. There were already signs of "Reduce Speed Now" and "Slow Down: Accident Prone"and yet he didn't bother to follow the rules. There were also times that we might hit not just one, but two vehicles.

```Reckless driving```
