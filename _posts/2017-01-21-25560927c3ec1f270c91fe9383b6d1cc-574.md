### Name of taxi: Unknown

Driver was extremely rude. When we suggested to take a particular route since we are more familiar with it, he insisted on his route instead and even went as far as saying, in an arrogant manner, that "mas mahal pa babayaran ko kaysa sa ibabayad niyo." Moreover, he did not turn on the meter at first and we even had to remind him to turn it on. Because of that, he recklessly drove the taxi -- speeding even on humps.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
