### Name of taxi: Bernardo Pili

Already got inside the cab before he said that he wants to start the ride without meter but decided to do so because i told him that he can be reported to LTO, started to act rude, I told him that I would show him a faster route then he said that "sige na doon na tayo dadaan andami mo pa sinasabi e". This asshole should have his taxi line removed as he is not fit to take passengers, he might do worse than that to future passengers. This should not be taken lightly if ltfrb is really true in what they are saying that public transport is safe and comfortable under their watch!

```No meter, Rude behavior```
