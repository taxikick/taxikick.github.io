### Name of taxi: Happy

East Fairview to North Fairview charged P150, didn't use meter we can't get off because airconditioning unit is at the back of cab, counterflowed and almost hit a car from opposite dicrection. When we got off driver didn't assist, just left the aircon at the sidewalk! Very rude old driver! 

```No meter, Contracting```
