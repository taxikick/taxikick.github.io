### Name of taxi: Unknown

It just happened today, I live in Talisay and my office is located in the City, I asked the taxi driver to be at least appropriate if he will be driving because I might be late. He was too fast, the meter runs too fast as well, it does change every 10 sec so charge was too high. Good thing I was not late! Fair enough.

```Over charging, No receipt```
