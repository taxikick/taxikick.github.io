### Name of taxi: Unknown

Meter rate is PHP 220.50, I paid 211 since it should be minus 10 from the metered rate. However, the taxi driver refused minus 10 because of the increasing gas price and other nonsense reasons. He then gave PHP 80 as a change instead of 100.

```Over charging, No receipt```
