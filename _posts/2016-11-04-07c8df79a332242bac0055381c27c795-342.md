### Name of taxi: unknown

I'm was about to pay my meter bill, it was P159, so i gave him P200 but when i was about to ask for my change he refused on giving it to me insisting that my meter bill is not enough because the location was too far. I tried refusing until we had an arguement. then he told me to just add P20 on the said amount. when we were about to go out of the cab, he said the word "ulol" and when we were about to cross the street he tried to threaten on running over us. 

(Reckless Driving incident) 
He keeps on using the gutter on over taking the trucks ahead of us

```Over charging, No receipt```
