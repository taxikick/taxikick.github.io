### Name of taxi: Unknown

This happened around 12 noon. Me and my friend took a taxi from J centre mall to Ayala. Since it was raining, I decided to ask the taxi driver if it is okay to drop me at Ayala and proceed to my friends place which is near JY square in Lahug. When I get off the taxi, everything seems to be okay. However, my friend told me that when she arrived at the destination, the total fare was Php.148 so my friend gave him Php.160. My friend asked for a change, however the driver replied with a mad tune of voice saying that "Sakto ra ni. Naog na!" (itâ€™s enough) and asked my friend to go down which she immediately did. 

I am writing this not because I wanted to have that Php.12 change but I am writing this letter because I wanted to stop this kind of behavior.
