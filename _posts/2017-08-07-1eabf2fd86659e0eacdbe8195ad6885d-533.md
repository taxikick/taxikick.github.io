### Name of taxi: Not sure

It was rainy that evening, so we decided to have a taxi from Glorietta to Litex. We see this taxi and told him where we are heading, he refuse and left us without a word. It was very disappointing. So we tried to call another Taxi and the same thing happened. We decided to have book using Grab. Please review this Taxi driver and let them know that we are reporting them to learn from their mistakes, thank you.
