### Name of taxi: Dutch taxi tx2

Picked us up in front of Robinson Paco, for Sta Mesa where my co-employee will go down first & then myself in San Juan .  
He  said he will bring meter down for each stop ( "para  maging legal").
I protested  because  i will just let my co-employee  alight which will take a few seconds only.  I finally  said Ok but please give me a receipt.
I asked for a receipt on my final  stop ( I said "para maging legal"),  but he  said " ay napatay ko na yuong metro" . & SO HE IS NOT ABLE TO GIVE A RECEIPT.
 He even sarcastically said " masama ,'ata loob mo kung nanghihinayang  ka  sa  Php 40..."
Also along the way to San Juan    ( in V.Mapa) he even drove recklessly, by counterflowing and    trying  to scare a   tricycle going  on the opposite lane.
Driver's description : Fat with Huge bulging  belly, wearing  yellow shirt and  i think red or blue short pants. Deep Gravelly voice , or  "whisky" voice.
Taxi : old model white Hyundai Accent, on the front  passenger side window  there is a  lettering that says "Dutch tx2    443 440"  
Meter : is digital and dirty but number display dims from time to time.

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
