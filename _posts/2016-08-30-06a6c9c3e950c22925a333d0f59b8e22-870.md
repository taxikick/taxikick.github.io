### Name of taxi: K & Q TAXI 

WE WERE THREE PASSENGERS WHO HAD THREE DIFFERENT DROP LOCATIONS. HE WANTED TO RESTART THE METER EVERY DROP POINT. 

WE DEMANDED FOR OUR RECEIPT BUT HE DIDN'T ISSUE SAYING RUDELY, "WALANG RESIBO!" AFTER WE INSISTED, HE GAVE US RECEIPT OF A RESTARTED METER WHICH COSTED PHP 40. 

WE PAID HIM PHP 500 FOR AROUND PHP 178 BILL BUT DIDN'T GET EXACT CHANGE. 

I TOLD HIM THAT I WILL REPORT HIM TO HIS OPERATOR, HE REPLIED, "EH GINAGAWA NIYO KONG SERVICE! WALA AKONG PAKIALAM KUNG MAG-REPORT KAYO!" 

```No receipt, Rude behavior```
