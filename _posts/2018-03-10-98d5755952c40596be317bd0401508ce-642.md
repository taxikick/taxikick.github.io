### Name of taxi: Unknown

We rode this taxi (TYU263) from Upper McKinley Hill to Antero Virata Taguig. Our fare based on the meter is only 96 pesos so I gave the driver 100 pesos. I thanked him after I handed him the money and he said that if that's all and if i'm not going to add for the fare. I told him that that's on the meter so that's what I'm going to pay. He's asking for more while it was clearly stated what our fare was. He stares at me badly as he drove away from us and even took a glance on his side mirror. 

TIP is given voluntarily and not should be asked by drivers.
