### Name of taxi: i forgot the name

The driver was already being rude when he asked us where we were going to drop off, he was acting annoyed. We told him to stop the taxi at this location but he kept on driving as if he has not heard anything. I thought he was not listening but I had 2 companions with me who were asking him to stop the taxi but he would not and he just kept looking at us through the mirror. He eventually stopped but he took us far away from our original destination. We had to walk uphill and it was hard because my left foot was sprained. We were scared because this place is somewhat far from the city center. I was with my cousin and my 9 year old sister who was also scared. 

```Rude behavior, Out of line```
