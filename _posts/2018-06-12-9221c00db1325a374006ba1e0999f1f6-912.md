title: ABH1012 - NAIA TERMINAL 3 TO QUIRINO STATION
---

### Name of taxi: AIRPORT TAXI (YELLOW TAXI)

When I am about to go down he told me that his meter is broken. Then he asked me if what is my usual fare from NAIA to Quirino station then I told him that I am usually charged between 190 to 250 dpending on the traffic. Then he insisted that I should pay him 600 and I can't do anything because its 1 am.

```Over charging, No meter```
