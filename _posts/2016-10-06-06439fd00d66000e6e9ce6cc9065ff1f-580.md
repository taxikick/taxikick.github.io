title: UWF222 - Ayala Edsa near Shell Gasoline Station
---

### Name of taxi: MY SPACE

Driver insists to add Php50 to the fare because we are 3 persons.  Usually, the fare from Ayala Edsa near Shell Gasoline Station going to McKinley is only Php80+.  In the end, we gave him Php100.  I have asked for receipt so he printed a receipt and it fell off.  Then he said that there is no more receipt.  I did not bother to get it since the driver seems violent.

```Over charging, Contracting```
