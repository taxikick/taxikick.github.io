### Name of taxi: m.g.e

Okay so this night there was a taxi whose plate number was indicated earlier , hit a man who was just walking along the sidewalk infront of our house . And as stated by my cousin who saw the whole thing. "mabilis magpatakbo ung taxi ng biglang nabangga niya ung lalaki na nasa gilid na nga ng kalsada." The taxi hit the man in the side mirror of his cab. Apparently due to the strong impact , tumilapon ung lalaki  measures about the height of two average person . Sad to say the taxi driver just stop his car then drive his car faster and he escaped from the scene

```Reckless driving```
