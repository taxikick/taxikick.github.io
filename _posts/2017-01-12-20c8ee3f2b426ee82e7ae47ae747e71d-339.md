### Name of taxi: Unaware

Me and my pregnant wife decided to wait for a taxi in front of SM North around 7:10 pm since its raining and buses from cubao route are full. Im annoyed because most of the taxi drivers we talked rejected us but at least they politely replied when we said our drop point until this special one caught my attention. This driver stopped his taxi and asked us  our destination but when we said the location he shook his head and rudely drove his taxi and didnt even  reply to us. This made me mad because 1st this driver likes to pick his passengers and 2nd  he is very rude. Please teach this guy a lesson

```Choosing passengers, Rude behavior```
