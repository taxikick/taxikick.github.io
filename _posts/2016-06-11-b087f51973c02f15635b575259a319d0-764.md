### Name of taxi: 

We were already boarded inside the taxi and is near our destination. When we asked him to turn to our street he rudely said, " Masikip dyan! Hindi ako papasok dyan! Hanggang dito lang ako."  Our street, although relatively narrow, has a one-way policy to accomodate cars even vans. We were also with a sick patient that is why we insist that he drive us to our destination yet he continued to be rude.

```Choosing passengers, Rude behavior```
