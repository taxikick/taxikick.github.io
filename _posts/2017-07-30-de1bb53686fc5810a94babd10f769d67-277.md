### Name of taxi: ???

He charged us 500 pesos instead of 300. He kept talking to us, distracting us, I think. He was in a blue poloshirt and his phone kept ringing, maybe he was texting. I couldnt tellexactly because me and my friend felt really dizzy even though we didnt have motion sickness. I woke up when we were almost there and realized his meter wasnt working. I wanted to say somthing but I was too dizzy to even get my phone. I managed to take a picture of his plate number and phone number on the window tho. When both me and my friend got off the taxi, we were both so dizzy that we couldnt even cross the road properly. I really want to report him but I cant remember what his taxi is and what it looks like, actually. My mind was clouded that time.

```Over charging, No meter```
