### Name of taxi: STURDY

I told the driver "Sorry kuya 500 pala pera ko, 50 nalang po barya ko". It was 8:45am that is why I gave him a heads up. He scolded me, and I dont mind because I know its my fault as well. So I just shrug it off and pretended that I'm listening to my music. He was listening to a radio program whose caller is confessing the "deed" that she and her partner is doing. Then the driver asked me if I heard that. Thinking that he will just tell me that it was funny, I just smiled and said yes. He looked in the mirror staring at me and told me with an evil grin "Ganyan din ba gustong gawin sau ng bf mo?". I just look away and pretended that nothing happened. Mind you I was wearing long sleeves and a long skirt but I still feel violated.

```Rude behavior```
