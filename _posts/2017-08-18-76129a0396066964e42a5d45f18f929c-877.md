### Name of taxi: Unknown

Inikot ikot kami, i know alam niya yung Tandamg Sora cuz he never asked twice when we said our location. It was 3 A.M. And then when i woke up, we were already at LITEX. Tangina lang. Then, i asked if i could talk to the operator for the incident and then he hid his ID and said no need but still insisted that we were the ones to blame. Our usual fare no matter the traffic is, is from 150-170. But the metro was already 260. IMAGINE THAT. I want the driver to be suspended at least. Because i dont want more people to be abused by taxis considering that Uber is no longer available. Please contact me, I am determined to file a case.
