### Name of taxi: was not able to get

The taxi driver was smoking when I got into the taxi. He said the guys he just dropped off because they wanted to go to Alabang and only charge them by the meter, he wanted extra. Upon dropping me off, my meter was 120php and I handed him 150php and asked for change. He said I needed to pay him 170php because it was "plus 50php" for BGC. I gave him 200php because I didn't have any smaller bill and I was running late. I didn't have time to argue.

```Smelly interiors, Not giving exact change```
