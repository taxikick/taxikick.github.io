### Name of taxi: AS Bartolini

The meter is on even before I sat... already at P43.50. I gave him P80 for the P82 meter reading when I get off at Evangelista near INC Chapel on 6/15/17 between 3:30-3:45pm. The driver opened his window and shouted/scolded at me saying "ang kapal ng mukha mo! magbabayad ka kulang". I said eh nakabukas na yang metro mo bago pa ako sumakay... I am a PWD and should be entitled for 20% discount. What I paid him is more for his pandaraya and non-giving of discount as the LTFRB orders.
