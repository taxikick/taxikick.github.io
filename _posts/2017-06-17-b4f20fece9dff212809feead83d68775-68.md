### Name of taxi: RYO AKI TAXI INC

I rode a cab from Ortigas to Quezon City. While I was already inside the car, the driver told me to pay an "additional Php50 dahil traffic po." This was of course a complete bullsh*t because it only took us 30 minutes to get my home from my office. I did not want to pay the extra fee but because it was already late in the evening and I was too desperate to go home, I did not argue with this *sshole of a driver. However, I made it a point to get a receipt in order to file a complaint against him. I wasn't able to get his name though as his ID wasn't visible which, I believe, is another violation. 

```Over charging```
