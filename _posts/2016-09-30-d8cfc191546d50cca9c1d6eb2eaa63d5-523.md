### Name of taxi: Unknown

I had to pay him 64 pesos so I gave him 100 and I was shocked that he just returned me 5pesos then I said "my money is 100 kuya" then he said it's just 70 pesos, how come it become 100? 
I don't want that to happen again to other passengers so I am really willing to report him right away!!!!
