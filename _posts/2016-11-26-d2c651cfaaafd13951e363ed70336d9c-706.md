title: GXV517 - General Maxilom Extension, fronting the Bureau of Quarantine

### Name of taxi: Couldn't catch it since the cab sped off.

My father drove me to work. He was driving on the middle lane of General Maxilom Extension, by the DSWD Region VII and Bureau of Quarantine area. On his way to crossing the intersection, the cab in question forced its way into our lane. The cab grazed the right side of my father's bumper, overtook our car and sped off. Things happened so quickly that I only managed to get the cab's plate number.
