### Name of taxi: RED "KR TAXI" LOGO

Driver asked for our destination before letting us in. Choosing passengers.

Driving 75-100kPh in city traffic. Counter-flowing constantly. Many times almost hitting objects/people. When told to slow down, responds in bisaya: "I'm in a rush. YOU'RE LUCKY I PICKED YOU UP"

I had to get change inside the house (because I know these taxi drivers DONT give change) and he constantly impatiently honks his horns. It is 10PM+ in the evening. The neighborhood, especially OUR ELDERS, are asleep.

```Choosing passengers, No receipt```
