### Name of taxi: ALL-MA

I think the meter is tampered, i take a taxi every from the house to technohub, my fare usually ranges from 117 to 125 at most, but this taxi meter charged my 134! I paid 140 the driver didnt even give me any change, i remarked to him that the taxi meter overcharged he didnt seem to hear me. I thought that its so useless to argue and decided to report instead.

```Over charging```
