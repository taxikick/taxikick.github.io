### Name of taxi: Unknown

We rode this taxi from PNR to Tuding, Itogon. The taxi driver upon knowing of our destination started acting rudely. You could hear deep sighs and repeated asking of questions regarding our destination. He also wanted to passby a longer route because as he said "traffic sa Teacher's Camp" but when we passed by at 11PM it wasn't even traffic. Cars were freely passing by there. Again, taxi driver was a rude condescending bastard, who overcharged and acted out of line during the whole ride. 

```Over charging, Reckless driving```
