### Name of taxi: Neanias Taxi

This Taxi Driver Geronimo Gonzales asked for a contract of Php200 from San Pedro to Alabang, i refused and tried to get off his taxi. He did not slow down to get me off but instead told me that he will take another female passenger 'para kumita naman', witout asking for my consent. The female passenger came and asked how the fare will be between the two of us. The taxi driver just said that it will be via the meter. But upon getting off on our destination the taxi driver asked us to pay the 148 peso fare individually.

```Over charging```
