### Name of taxi: .

i was in a hurry to get home, so i hailed a cab. he was in the regular cab lane, so i got confused when he said that he was an airport taxi service. i wanted to get out, but he was already speeding out and convinced me to stay in the cab. i should have insisted but i was too tired and i assumed it wouldn't be too expensive since pasong tamo was very close. he charged me 850 and did not provide a receipt.

```Over charging, No meter```
