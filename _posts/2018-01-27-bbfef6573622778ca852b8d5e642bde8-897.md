### Name of taxi: RX 0487

It was only 5:30pm but the driver refused to accept us as passengers because the location of our house is located in  limited area. He was also rude considering that our shopping bags was already loaded on his taxi but we had to take it out after rejecting. 

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
