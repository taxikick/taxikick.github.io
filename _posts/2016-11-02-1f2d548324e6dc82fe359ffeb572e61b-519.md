### Name of taxi: Unknown

He made a mistake in missing the turn and turned left instead of right when i directed him to the next intersection which sparked his ego when i corrected him. I never said anything bad to him, but his behavior suddenly changed to intimidation. He cussed me uttering the vulgar words "king ina mo" so i opted to go to the barangay station in order to settle the dispute. But to my dismay he wouldnt even come close to the barangay station and opted to act threating and violent. If not for my friend paying the fare who knows how it wouldve escalated to. He should not drive at all for the public in my opinion because he cant control his temper and if not for my sense of judgement things might have gotten physical endangering he life of other people who never did him wrong

```Verbal harassment```
