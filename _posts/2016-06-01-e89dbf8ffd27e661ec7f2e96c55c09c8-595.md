### Name of taxi: not sure

so I booked a grab a cab from my condo at One mckinley place, When i got the notification that he arrived I was in hurry to meet him in the lobby, but when I called him he said he's gone because he was blocking the way, I'm like "Hello sakto pag arrive mo sa location bumaba na ako" He said na kept on waiting for a long time that's why he left, the way he talked to was really rude kaya tinayaran ko ndin sya. It's really disappointing na may ganoong klaseng driver walang modo, ang sabi pa sakin ng guard wala naman daw taxi pa na dumarating. so obviously mali nya!
