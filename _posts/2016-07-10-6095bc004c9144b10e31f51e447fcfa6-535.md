### Name of taxi: ken taxi

Our location was in Ekits House pocherohan going to SM. It's not that far but he chose to take the road going to Panagdait instead of going directly to the road of Mabolo to SM. We asked him why he didnt drive directly to Mabolo but he didnt say a word. So, 
we made a turn from Panagdait to North Bus that took a longer trip. 
Then we asked the taxi driver if he has a change o 500php and he said no. so, he should have done something but instead, drive right to SM so When we got to SM and handed him the bill, he said "wala akong change nyan". My partner stepped outside and was the one who looked for the change (he shud be the one to look for a change though). then my partner came back and unfortunately, he didnt get a change. so we asked the driver to drive back to the nearest gasoline station so we can make the change. We were forced to purchase something in the gasoline's convenience store since they dont have a change.l too. Then, We drove back to sm and the fair is now 120 instead of 70 only. not to mention the taxi stinks and without an aircon.  the driver just rolled down his window down so that he will not feel hot not giving a damn about the passengers at the back. Very unprofessional! Worst taxi experience ever. By the way his id is not in display. A possible rapist by the night!
