title: UVC380 - NAIA - Terminal 2
---

### Name of taxi: Katwin

We went to NAIA around 11 am to see my Boyfriend's Mom back from Florida (she's on a connecting flight to Davao). Around 1 pm, we decided that we should go to MOA to grab our lunch since we did not eat breakfast just to see his mom and have enough time to talk with her cause she's in a hurry. We waited for a Taxi in the Departure area and there wasn't actually a line since it's still early. When we finally got in the Katwin Taxi, about 5 minutes through the ride, we saw the Automated meter wasn't turned on. So we asked the Driver why his meter wasn't turned on. He just simply told us that their usual fare from Terminal 2 to MOA was 250 pesos. I didn't believe him cause we rode a taxi from Vito Cruz to Terminal 2 and it only amounted to 170 pesos considering we got caught in Traffic. I wanted to reason out with him, but due to eagerness to just go to moa and my hunger, We just said okay.

(P.S: I think he did that on purpose cause he knew that we we're both students. And are in a hurry.)
