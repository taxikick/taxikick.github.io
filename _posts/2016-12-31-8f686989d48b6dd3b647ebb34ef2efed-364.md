### Name of taxi: WMJJ taxe service, Inc

We rode a cab hoping to get another one cos we were a lot but he insisted on getting us. Ince we rode his cab he insisted on going through the skyway and did not open the meter. When the cab was moving a few blocks away from where we were he said that 500 would be the fixed rate and i said that it was too much and he gave a long speech abt it. He may have noticed that we were with some tourists

```Over charging, No meter```
