### Name of taxi: Manchester

Instead of Php105 I paid Php150 because he asked for it. He kept looking over to the right by the passenger’s seat. I think he didn’t notice that I saw the knife that lay there. Immediately I let him stop atleast 5 minutes away from my destination and paid him. I was afraid he would follow me so, I stood by the waiting shed beside a police station. I saw him circle back.
