### Name of taxi: Miss world taxi

I rode a taxi from punta sta ana manila around 10:30pm and arrived at mckinley around 11pm. U dont have cash and asked the driver that i will withdraw. Upon withdrawing, i gave him my 1000pesos and then he looked at it. There's a car behind him so i thought he would just move his taxi to giveway to that other car, but he suddenly drove away. I still have 800pesos change. I really felt bad.

```Rude behavior, Not giving exact change```
