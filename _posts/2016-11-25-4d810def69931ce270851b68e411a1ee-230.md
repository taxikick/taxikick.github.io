title: AOA9562 - Kalayaan Ave. near Quezon City Hall

### Name of taxi: Violago-Ilagan

Average rate from Eton Centris to Urology Center should be around 68-75 pesos only, this time I noticed the taxi meter tick 6 times (from 57.50, 61.00, 64.50, 68.00, 71.50, 75.00, 78.50) around QC City Hall (from QMC side to Kalayaan side, this is such a short distance!). Told my driver his meter's tampered but he's not stopping. Had to drop myself off near Matalino St since my fare already reached 78.50 pesos (above my average fare) and I'm still a few blocks from home!
