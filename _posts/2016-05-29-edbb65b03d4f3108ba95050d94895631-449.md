### Name of taxi: 

Gudevening sir/madam!I am Emer B. Martin. I am a motorcycle rider here at Marikina city. I would like to report a certain taxi driver with a plate no. EBX 931. It happened at around 6:10 pm, May 29, 2016.It started because he wanted to overtake my motorcycle, he drove his car very fast and recklessly nothwithstanding he has a passenger, he kept horning me but because I was on the right lane i ignored him. He also called me "gago".He even alighted in his taxi and threathened to punch me here at p.tuazon near sta. Lucia mall.I would gradly appreciate for your immediate action on this matter so that our public transport drivers would be professional and courteous at all times for the safety of the riding public. I want to file a formal complaint against the said driver.Thank you very much and more power.
