title: UVZ525 - From sm north to jam liner
---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

My friend and I have boarded a taxi near SM West bldg. infront of SM North EDSA. We have informed the driver that we have 2 destinations. One would be going down the Five Star bus terminal and the other in JAC liner at Kamuning. He let us board and after passing trinoma he begins to rant that we should have taken 2 separate taxies. We have told him we told you our destinations and you let us board and went your way. Then his driving became reckless and we became uncomfortable with his way of driving. Another is that I became so worried with my friend due to the drivers way of driving might trigger her vertigo. While we continue our trip, his rants and unease driving continues. As I reach my destination at Five Star terminal, my friend was left in the taxi. In there the rant continued and he doesnt want to drive my friend to her destination. My friend talked back telling him that he was the first driver we encountered that is so rude and inconsiderate. My friend didnt let the driver have his way of letting her get off and not bring her to JAC liner. In the end it was solved by having an additional flag rate on our bill. All in all it was a rude and inconsiderate driver. My friends vertigo was triggered by his reckless driving.

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
