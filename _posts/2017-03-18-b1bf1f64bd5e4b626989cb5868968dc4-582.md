### Name of taxi: Unknown

He tried contracting me. When I said no, his mood got sour. When he asked me where I was going, I told him the place saying my destination is near that place. Later when he got me to the wrong place he said, "andami kasing sinasabi." I only told him my destination is near that place I said. When we finally got to my destination, he glared at me and my 11 year old brother. How can we let these drivers traumatize their passengers? 

```Contracting, Rude behavior```
