### Name of taxi: Sheperds

Driver refused to take the route I wanted. Told me to get out in the middle of the road. I take the same route everyday but this is the first time that a taxi driver refused and was very rude about it. Kept making comments about how taxi drivers are always right. 

```Rude behavior```
