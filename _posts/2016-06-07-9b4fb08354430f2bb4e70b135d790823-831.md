### Name of taxi: CJMCO

When I go to work I always eat my lunch at the taxi. But this driver drive me crazy. I think thrice natapon ung coffee ko. Nasusuka ako while eating kasi sobrang bilis nia magdrive na maliko liko and singit dun singit jan. I told him na this way dumaan since un ung alam ko and I know safe ako pag dun dumaan, But no, he refuse my request and follows what he want kasi traffic daw doon. Thinking na everyday ako dumadaan dun at never ako nakaencounter ng traffic dahil hindi naman rush hour yun. Its from 1-2pm travel time namin. Traffic ba yun? He said nagmamadali sya kasi may sundo pa daw sya, edi sana di na lang nia ako sinakay diba? Di ko nakita ung name nia since ung ID is hindi nakaharap sa pax when you're already seated inside. Please do action on this.

```No receipt, Reckless driving```
