title: AAB2346 - Bagong Bario Caloocan and Malabon
---

### Name of taxi: Katsuari

I ride a taxi for the same route from bagong barrio to malabon and it is usually ranges from 80 to 100 depending on traffic, but this one time it reaches 120 on a very light traffic, and when we picked up our companion and headed to harrison we rode the same taxi and the meter reaches 260 but on our way home we took the same route on another taxi with heavier traffic and it only reaches 180. and I noticed the he was also flickering switches so I suspect he has a triggering mechanism to add to his meter fares.

```Tampered or broken meter```
