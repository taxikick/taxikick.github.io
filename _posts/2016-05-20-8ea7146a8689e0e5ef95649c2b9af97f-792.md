title: UVG758 - Dusit thani, makati
---

### Name of taxi: 

Just came from business meeting ang hailed taxi from dusit thani going to bgc. Taxi refused to start meter ang asked for 300 pesos. I refused and told him to use his meter instead because i did not have enough money. Driver stated "galing ka nga ng dusit eh. Eh pano mo babayaran yung taxi" i told him that i am only willing to pay if he uses his taxi meter. He stated it was broken and he would only drive me to my destination for 300. Dusit thani employees can attest to this. Please keep these kind of drivers from taking advantage of people. Thank you very much.

```Over charging, No meter```
