### Name of taxi: NOEL & JOEL TAXI

I rode a taxi on royal, apolonio balintawak qc going to goodwill homes 1 novaliches. A day before i just had a bill of 140php. During my ride the driver forgot  to start the meter. I noticed it when we are in monuz edsa already,  then he starts the meter. During the trip i noticed fast meter because when we are in quirino ave area its already 140php. It should be lesser because he start the meter a bit late like 2km have passed already. When we arrived at the destination i ask for receipt and have this datas start 10:51 end 11:17 wait 11:04 dist 10.2 fare 169.50. So i check in waze and google maps it should only take 9km same route. And no to mention he started the meter late

```Tampered or broken meter```
