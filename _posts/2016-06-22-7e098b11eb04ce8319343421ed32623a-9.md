title: UVG213 - Sucat SLEX Exit
---

### Name of taxi: Noelie

Accepted my ride request to Soldier's Hills, Muntinlupa from near Sucat SLEX exit. When the car was already moving through the West service road, he demanded for additional P100 since there will be no more passengers coming from that area. He refused to let me down as well, and accused other drivers who don't ask for additional money that they are part of crime schemes and have ulterior motifs. 

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
