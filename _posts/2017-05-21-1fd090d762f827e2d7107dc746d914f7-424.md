---

### Name of taxi: Unknown

We will go to MIA ter3 that time riding a bus from cubao to taft. When we arrived at taft avenue terminal, then there is a man who called us to ride a taxi. We ask him and the driver of the taxi where is the Mcdo taft since bus terminal route to terminal 3 is near to that menttioned. They answered that they dont know. We are forced to ride a taxi because we can't find either where is the bus terminal for MIA TER3. 

The taxi starts to run, then a few meters, we saw tha MCDO and we decided to stop and walk instead but will pay the cost of our ride according to its meter. Taxi driver said that there is a UTURN there, I will send off you there. We agreed. 1 to 2 minutes, we arrived at Mcdo. We questioned him where is your meter? He replied, I don't have a meter because 200 pesos is the fixed rate. We deny his claim that we must pay according to the meter. However, he insisted that 200 pesos. We deny again, until he said, give me 100 pesos. We gave him a 100 pesos so that our arguments will end there and we'll be late to our flight. 


```Over charging, No meter```
