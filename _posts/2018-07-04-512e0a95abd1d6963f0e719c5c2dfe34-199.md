### Name of taxi: Not sure

Before he dropped me off, I asked how much was I going to pay because I canâ€™t see his meter, maybe because he turned it off or it was really defective. He then charged me with 350 pesos from Baclaran to Cargo Terminal which is clearly signifying that he violated the rights of a passenger by having no meter shown and for charging extra fee. 

```Over charging, No meter```
