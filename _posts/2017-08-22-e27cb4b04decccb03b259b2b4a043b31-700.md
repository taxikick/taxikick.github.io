### Name of taxi: Didn't get the name

The cab driver took advantage of my desperation as he was aware that the Grab App was down this morning and that I was going to be late for work. He immediately told me "Php 150".  My destination was at Topaz Rd in Ortigas Center which would clearly cost less than Php 100 with the taxi meter.
