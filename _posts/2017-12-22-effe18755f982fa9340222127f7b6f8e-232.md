I always go to qc from vmapa, and taxi rate usually range from 160 to 200. As i entered the taxi, the meter rate ws already 71.00 and the driver told me that dagdagan mo nlng, and when i arrived the meter rate was 170, which is correcr, but the driver asked for 250, and i gave 300, he told me wala syang barya, i find this very abusive. I am only a student and afraid to fight back
