### Name of taxi: Marjane

i got  the Marjane Taxi ABD 7334 in front of BPI - Arseana Branch today Feb 8 between 2 pm -3:30 pm ( I forgot the exact time). I am heading back to my office at Five eCom in MOA Complex.

It's been years i have not ride a taxi.  Fankly speaking, i do not know how much is the start of the taxi fare in Philippines.

I trusted the driver (do not know his name). it journey took less than 15 min. When I got at my destination, I look at the meter and it was 117!!!

Half way before we got here at Five eCom, i saw that the fare was 92.50 I was about to ask the driver why it is so expensive, but i just want to check first, thinking probably the fare was just right.

When i arrived here at Five eCom, the fare was 117！！！

I was totally shocked! I paid 120 to the driver, he even said he has no change for me. At the end he gave me 10 as change!

This is a scam! I hate being fooled!

I tried to call the number written on both windows at the back of the taxi:
     Tel  291-0105
     Cel  0921-7186077

Both numbers cannot be reached! THIS IS SCAM!!

Is there any way to get my money back? Ca.n i file a case on the taxi company?
