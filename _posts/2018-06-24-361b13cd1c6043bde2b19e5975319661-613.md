### Name of taxi: M.G.E

The driver is asking for a exact amount without the meter. And this is the second bad encounter with the taxi driver first the driver don't want to board us because he ask if where we going when i answer sm north he refuse to get us there and let us get out.. very frustrating especially we have a 5 years old son with us.
