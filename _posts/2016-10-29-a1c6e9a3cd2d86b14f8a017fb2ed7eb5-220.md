title: AAM3868 - Manila Hotel to ManilaMed
---

### Name of taxi: Andrea Tirao

1. He refused to board me at Manila Hotel and he was telling the attendant that "akala ko ba iba ang ibibifay mo sa akin"

2. On the way, he was scolding me and ranting why I have to go to ManilaMed.  While I was answering back telling him to drop me off already, he said "shut up"

3. He was swerving at Roxas Blvd that his rear side was hit.

4. When I told him "bakit ka naninigaw?" He answered, "ganyan talaga boses ko, ligawan pa kita e"

5. When I paid him at the end of the ride, I gave him P10 off the flagdown rate (i don't really know if this is lifted already). And he said "Tanga! Matagal ng lifted yan!" I gave him the P10 and slammed the door shut.
