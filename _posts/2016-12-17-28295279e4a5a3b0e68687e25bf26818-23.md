title: GXV293 - Cebu City
---

### Name of taxi: Scorpion Taxi

This taxi driver counterflowed from a very significant distance until he was able to squeeze himself back to his lane.. Had he not been honked at, he wouldnt have cut a different driver just to get back to his lane.. The worst part there was that he was the one who yelled at us as if we were at fault.. Abusive and rude taxi drivers ruin the image of taxi drivers in its entirety which should not be cz there are polite and honest taxi drivers there too.. but human as we are, we lose our faith and trust in them all because of the rotten tomatoes in the organization.. In this case, this gxv-293 is one heck of a rotten tomato..

```Reckless driving, Rude behavior```
