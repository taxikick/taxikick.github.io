### Name of taxi: Not captured

We are going home from Dominion bus line cubqo and taxi uvm 491 was the taxi that I manage to talk to while his current passenger is getting their things. The driver is actually analyzing if he will give us a ride or not base on our drop off point. When I told him that We would like to go to pasig he refused, I ask why? He just said that he will eat while infact he almost allow to get in. My only concern here is that drivers should not choose passenger.

```Refused boarding```
