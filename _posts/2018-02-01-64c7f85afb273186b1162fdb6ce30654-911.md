### Name of taxi: Tyrone james

Boarded the taxi thinking it was metered.. when i said i would only be going to lrt edsa, he then started driving and said 150 lang po kc malayo. Thinking to myself? Lrt is wakable if only i have no heavy luggage. And ask him di po ba to metered. He didnt reply and i look over, he did not turn on the meter..and then he said malayo pa daw at iikot. He did go around and but we got there within 10 minutes or so. I paid the 150 because he wouldn't budge even when i said wla nmn traffic and reason out with him.

```No meter```
