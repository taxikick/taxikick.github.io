### Name of taxi: Unknown

beware of this taxi driver. while we are approaching 5th avenue crossing around 3pm today December 28 2017, this taxi with plate number UPO774 suddenly turn to our lane in short he cut me drastically without any signal. they almost hit us, good thing is suddenly turn the wheel to the right to prevent the crash. then when green light is on he go and stop and go like he is provoking a fight. We did not go down because we dont want any road rage. we just took a photo of the taxi.  please take note of this and please address to authority in charge. this might cause accidents and danger to everyone. Thank you.
