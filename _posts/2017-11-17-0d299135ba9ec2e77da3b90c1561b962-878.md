### Name of taxi: D'Avis Taxi

The driver slowed in traffic for me to get in.

Once in he demanded a fixed and very high price for transport to my destination. When I asked him to turn the meter on he refused and asked me to get out.

When I responded this was illegal he became upset.

```Refused boarding, Contracting```
