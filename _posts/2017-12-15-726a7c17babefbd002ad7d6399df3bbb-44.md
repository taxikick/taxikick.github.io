### Name of taxi: Unknown

We boarded his cab and when told we were heading for Liloan (north of cebu), his excuse was that he will be fetching a dialysis patient 9 AM at a hospital and we were out of the way. We told him we will report him and his response was "sumbong lang"

```Refused boarding```
