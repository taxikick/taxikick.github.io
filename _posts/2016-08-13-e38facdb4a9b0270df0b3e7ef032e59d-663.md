### Name of taxi: 

I hailed this taxi and it stopped beside me. When I told him we want to be dropped at West Rembo Makati city just 3kms away, he refused. When I said 'I will report you' he immediately raised his middle finger at me then drove away. I was shocked when he did it a second time when he was far away. Not a very good experience

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
