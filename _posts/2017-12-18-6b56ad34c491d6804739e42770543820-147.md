### Name of taxi: No idea

We are about to onboard inside his cab...when we told him that our dropping point is GTDL, Val City... he refused told us in a rude manner.. "bigla bigla n lng kc kayo sumasakay.. eh gagarahe na ko..." But then after that another person approached.. then he accepted the passenger... ths is dscrimnation.. that rude driver should be reprimanded! He doesnt have manners at all!  Taxis are no longer patronized because of drivers like him.. screw him!

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
