### Name of taxi: CTC Taxi 

When we said we wanted to go to lahug, he just went the long road for i guess more meter and more money. When we asked where we were going he said it was more traffic but i thought he would turn on the nearest turn but he didnt.. Usually we just pay 90. But this time its 113. If we didnt talked to him the 3rd time it could be more. Maybe he needed more money but many ppl do need as well but are doing it honestly.. I just dont want it to happen again  or abuse fellow ppl who are also working and on a budget
