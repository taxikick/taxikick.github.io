### Name of taxi: (White metered taxi)

It was still early in the morning. A Guy picked a taxi for me and said that taxi is a simple- metered one. I was shocked because he hopped in it also. Instead of the standard metered taxi that I usually ride on, the meter was different. It was metered but per actual meter. The trip had gone for 30 meters and I was charged by the driver 900 pesos. I was asked 30 pesos per meter and was scammed by the driver and the person who picked him up for me. Beware folks of TWP 777!

```Over charging, Tampered or broken meter```
