### Name of taxi: NJ Transport

Dear Sir/Madam, Last August 16, 2016 at 6:50 am I was about to make a u turn at ADB avenue in front of ADB. There were no vehicle in front of me. As I was making a u turn I was shocked to find in front of me a rampaging white car which later I realized was a taxi. I honked my horn and the taxi almost hit the side where my daugther was. I did not let go of the horn then he stopped. He opened the window and shouted at us. I was shocked that this reckless drive had the nerve to shout at us when he was the one who placed my daugther and I in danger. Then screechingly he sped up like a race car drive towards Ortigas. When I got my composure back I went on and told my daughter to take a picture of his plate number. It a white taxi NJ Transport with plate number AAN9168.
