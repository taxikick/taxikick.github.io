### Name of taxi: Onassis

Dear Sir/Madam:

Would you please help me retreive my belongings left at the compartment of the taxi with plate no. ACO5890 under the Onassis taxi operator. I have inside my clothes and my Acer Laptop. 

On July 10, 2017, About 2:30AM we arrived at St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City to visit my father who was admitted at the same hospital. I was with my mother and a helper. I was busy assisting my mother because she could not walk by herself, while the helper fetch our bags. Then I looked for my bag which I remember putting inside the compartment Only to discover that  the helper doesn't have it. And I knew it was left in the compartment! I rush to check the driver but he's already gone.

I really don't know who to call for help. I hope this email request will be given consideration. 

Thanks you. Hoping for your favorable response.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Ranches
