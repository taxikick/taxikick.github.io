### Name of taxi: Fun taxi

We boarded the taxi at ortigas bus stop and asked the driver to bring us at bsa twin tower. After 15minutes on transit the driver said he is not aware where bsa twin tower is. As we are not from manila we used google map to help us, he started to yell at us that we should have not boarded his taxi if we do not know where the place is. We try telling him directions based on google map but he would yell at us saying "anong sabi mo?" He manuevered the car opposite to what we are telling him. And when we finally arrived at our destination and as we are bringing out our baggage he closed the door which hit my head. When we told him about it he angrily said we should pay extra for our baggage.
