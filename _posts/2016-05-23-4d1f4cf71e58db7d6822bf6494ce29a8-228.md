title: WQO-332 - SM Aura Premier

### Name of taxi: I was not able to get it. The plate number though is WQO-332 

I was waiting in line at the taxi stand outside the department store of SM Aura earlier today, may 23, 2016. The first cab refused to take me to cubao because he said its "coding" and he  can only fetch passengers within the Taguig area. So I asked the guard why do they allow cabs to line up when they can't bring passengers to their chosen destination. He said they do not have control over it and asked me to go to the next cab in line. This 2nd taxi driver refused me as well for the same reason so I asked him the same question "Why are you lining up when ur plate is "coding" and is now refusing passengers who wish to be fetched to outside taguig?". At this point he answered back in a very rude manner saying that do I not know Taguig is exempted from the color coding and started hurling incentives. I did not back down myself and told him he should have not lined up there in the first place, knowing that the taxi he is driving is coding. This is still considered as refusing passengers and should not be tolerated.
