### Name of taxi: I dont know

From SM Aura. Once inside the taxi and after 3 mins still meter not open and asking how much you will pay. I said according to the meter then he said you pay extra 40p otherwise you go out and take another taxi. Then he open meter then he said you pay this amount and +40P. 
Then he drop at McKinley Hill the meter shows 78 something P then I give 100P then he is still arguing and threaten me and said I will see next time and your very clever, asking again extra 40P but I left. 
ALSO THE SM GUARD IN TAXI LANE DID NOT GIVE THE PAPER FOR TAXI DETAILS.
