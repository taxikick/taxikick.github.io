### Name of taxi: I forgot but the taxi has blue color in it

Okay so here's what happened, we were at Batasan I asked him if he know Tapsi ni vivian and he said "bakit" tinikom ko nalang bibig ko di na ako nag marunong and after nun sa traffic niya na kami dinadaan at kung saan saan na malayo na sa sta lucia hanggang sa dinala niya na kami sa Loyola since I know that place I decided na bumaba nalang. We ended up paying him 200 but normally it would range from 100-130
