### Name of taxi: Unknown

I hailed this cab on my way home. The moment I told him where I am headed to, he claims to not know the directions to my destination. He was very rude since I am also not that familiar with the directions which is actually the reason why I decided to hail a cab since I'm not a local of Taguig. Cutting the story short, he charged me P200 which is a first time since I usually pay around P90 or so whenever I hail a cab from the same pickup point and destination. I usually don't like to complain and most especially since he was glaring at me when he was asking for the bill. Not to mention, THE TRIP DID NOT RUN ON A METER.

```Over charging, No meter```
