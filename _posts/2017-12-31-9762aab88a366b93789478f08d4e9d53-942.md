### Name of taxi: MGE

When I gave him a 500 pesos to pay my cab charge, he was so rude because U didnt have change. He demanded that I should have given the exact change or a smaller bill because he has no change! Customers are not obliged to inform my money to pay! He was so rude like so rude!!!!
