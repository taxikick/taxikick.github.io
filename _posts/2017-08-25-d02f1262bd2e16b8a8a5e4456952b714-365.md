### Name of taxi: I don't know

The plate number is AAZ 1577. The taxi refused to take us as passengers because according to him, it was traffic and raining. Yes, both are true but as a public utility vehicle, he should not refuse to take passengers. We also wanted to get home safely and it's not like we will not be paying him. Moreover, he mentioned that our destination was out of the way. He will only consider taking us as his passengers if we pay him in an amount he insisted without using the taximeter, which was 300 pesos. The pick up point was only in Pasay and the destination was in Vito Cruz. It is very unreasonable to pay 300 pesos for that. This is why we prefer UBER. Bring back UBER please.
