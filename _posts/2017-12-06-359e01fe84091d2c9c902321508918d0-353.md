### Name of taxi: Airport Meter Taxi

Got in taxi at airport. Driver said he didn’t know where the hotel was. I gave him address and he tried keying into WAZE but it wouldn’t load. I had to direct him but he kept taking the wrong road and I actually hadn’t to use my google maps to tell him where to go. Even then he looped past twice and I had to insist he was on the wrong side. If that’s not enough he didn’t have spare change and charged me 500 for a ride that would have cost me 70 on Grab. 

```Over charging, No receipt```
