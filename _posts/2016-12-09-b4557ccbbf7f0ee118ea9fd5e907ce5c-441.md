title: UVV954 - Morning Star Drive
---

### Name of taxi: Lady Allen

The taxi driver claimed that discounts only applied to senior citizens and refused to give me (PWD & student) a discount. The driver became very rude after refusing the discount. I ended up paying Php120 just so that he could go away.

The ride went from Katipunan Avenue to Morning Star Drive and cost Php134.50 w/o the discount.

```Over charging, Rude behavior```
