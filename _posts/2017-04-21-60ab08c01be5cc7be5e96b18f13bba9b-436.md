title: AEA6446 - From MNL airport to Sun Star Grand Hotel

### Name of taxi: Not sure

Was picked up from the airport by taxi, gave taxi driver name and address of hotel, was told it's far away and with traffic will take a very long time (1.5 hours away).  Ask if I wanted to pay a flat fee then turned meter off.  Ask how much I wanted to pay flat fee for since it's far away, told him I wanted to do meter instead. He then ask for address and said it's close by and turn meter back on again. While driving, he was on Facebook looking at video clips. Then he didn't follow GPS map, took wrong turn into traffic.  Should have taken less than 30 minutes but instead it was 52 minutes.
