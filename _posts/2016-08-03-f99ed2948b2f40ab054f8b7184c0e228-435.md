### Name of taxi: 

I got in the Taxi and told the driver where I was going. When we started moving, it was only then that the driver asked for additional payment. His reason was that because it was traffic. I got out of the taxi because I know it was still early (6:40am) for there to be traffic along our route. True enough, when I fortunately I was able to ride another cab, there was no traffic.

```Over charging```
