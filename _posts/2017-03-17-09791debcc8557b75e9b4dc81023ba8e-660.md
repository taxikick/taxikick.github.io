title: TXU384 - naia terminal 1

### Name of taxi: Metro Golden Cab

This taxi driver asked 500php from naia terminal 1 to greenfield district mandaluyong. He was also with 4 people asking for 100pesos from us and we cannot leave without giving the amount. All in all we wasted 600pesos. That was a terrible experience and the authority should take actions on this.

```Over charging, No meter```
