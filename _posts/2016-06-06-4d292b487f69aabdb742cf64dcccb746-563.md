### Name of taxi: Ryo Aki 

He entered the taxi bay. Windows were rolled open so I asked why. He had sharp eyes then asked what the hell was I thinking. I asked since it was unusual. I asked again if his a/c was not working and is there something wrong with the taxi. I had to check and ask since I had my kids and a senior citizen in tow. And sarcastically he answered rudely why would I think there is anything wrong with the taxi, muttered some bad words then sped away. He should not be allowed to drive a PUV and be of service to the public. 

```Refused boarding, Rude behavior```
